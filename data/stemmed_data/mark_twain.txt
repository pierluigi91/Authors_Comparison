 i glad damag saved would made unpopular owners
they alway hate anybodi name careless injur things
i went work learn shape river elud ungrasp object ever i tri get mind hand on chief
i would fasten eye upon sharp wood point project far river mile ahead me go labori photograph shape upon brain i begin succeed satisfaction would draw toward
if conspicu dead tree stand upon point cape i would find tree inconspicu merg general forest occupi middl straight shore i got abreast it
no promin hill would stick shape long enough make mind form realli was dissolv chang mountain butter hottest corner tropics
noth ever shape i come downstream born i went up
i mention littl difficulti mr bixby
he said that main virtu thing
if shape didnt chang everi three second wouldnt use
take place now instance
as long hill yonder one hill i boom right along way im going moment split top form v i know iv got scratch starboard hurry ill bang boat brain rock
if hill didnt chang shape bad night would aw steamboat graveyard around insid year
 it plain i got learn shape river differ way could thought ofupsid down wrong end first insid out foreandaft thortshipsand know gray night hadnt shape
so i set it
in cours time i began get best knotti lesson selfcomplac move front more
mr bixbi fixed readi start rear again
he open fashion how much water middl cross holeinthewall trip last
 i consid outrage
i said everi trip up leadsmen sing tangl place threequart hour stretch
how reckon i rememb mess that
 my boy youv got rememb it
youv got rememb exact spot exact mark boat lay shoalest water everyon five hundr shoal place st loui new orleans mustnt get shoal sound mark one trip mix
you must keep separate
 when i came again i said when i get i that ill abl rais dead i wont pilot steamboat make living
i want retir business
i want slushbucket brush im fit roustabout
i havent got brain enough pilot i i wouldnt strength enough carri around unless i went crutches
 now drop that
when i say ill learn footnot teach river vocabulary
 man river i mean it
and depend it ill learn kill him
 chapter  continu perplex there use argu person like this
i prompt put strain memori even shoal water countless crossingmark began stay me
but result same
i never could get one knotti thing learn anoth present itself
now i often seen pilot gaze water pretend read book book told nothing
a time came last however mr bixbi seem think far enough advanc bear lesson waterreading
so began do see long slant line face water
now that reef
moreover it bluff reef
there solid sandbar near straight side house
there plenti water close it mighti littl top it
if hit would knock boat brain out
do see line fring upper end begin fade away
 yes sir
 well low place head reef
you climb there hurt anything
cross over now follow along close reefeasi water therenot much current
 i follow reef along till i approach fring end
then mr bixbi said now get ready
wait till i give word
she wont want mount reef boat hate shoal water
stand bywaitwaitkeep well hand
now cramp down
snatch her
snatch her
 he seiz side wheel help spin around hard down held so
the boat resisted refus answer while next came surg starboard mount reef sent long angri ridg water foam away bows
now watch her watch like cat shell get away you
when fight strong tiller slip little jerky greasi sort way let trifle way tell night water shoal keep edg up littl little toward point
you well bar now bar everi point water come around form eddi allow sediment sink
do see fine line face water branch like rib fan
well littl reefs want miss end them run pretti close
now look outlook out
dont crowd slick greasylook place aint nine feet there wont stand it
she begin smell it look sharp i tell you
oh blazes go
stop starboard wheel

set back
the engin bell jingl engin answer promptly shoot white column steam far aloft scape pipes late
the boat smelt bar good earnest foami ridg radiat bow sudden disappeared great dead swell came roll forward swept ahead her careen far larboard went tear away toward shore
we good mile ought been final got upper hand again
dure afternoon watch next day mr bixbi ask i knew run next miles
i said go insid first snag point outsid next one start lower end higgin woodyard make squar cross and that right
ill back close next point
 but wasnt
he still i round enter upon piec river i misgiv about

for one thing tell stage rivertel whether there water less river along last trip
 the lead tell that
 i rather thought i advantag there
yes suppos lead lie
the bank would tell so youd stir leadsmen bit
there tenfoot bank last trip sixfoot bank now
what signify
 that river four feet higher last trip
 veri good
is river rise falling
 rising
 no aint
 i guess i right sir
yonder driftwood float stream
 a rise start driftwood keep float river done rising
now bank tell this
wait till come place shelv little
now here see narrow belt fine sediment that deposit water higher
you see driftwood begin strand too
the bank help ways
do see stump fals point
 ay ay sir
 well water root it
you must make note that
 why
 becaus mean there seven feet chute 
 but  long way river yet
 that benefit bank come in
there water enough  now yet may time get there bank keep us post along
you dont run close chute fall river upstream precious allow run downstream

the captain could stand upon hurrican deck pomp brief authority give five six order vessel back stream skipper reign over

it easili guessed consid pilot boundless authority great personag old steamboat days

i think pilot peopl i ever knew fail show degree embarrass presenc travel foreign princes
