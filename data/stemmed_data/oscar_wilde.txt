if ever i write again sens produc artist work two subject i desir express myself one christ precursor romant movement life the artist life consid
 the first is course intens fascinating i see christ mere essenti suprem romant type accidents wil even romant tempera also
he first person ever said peopl live flowerlik lives
 he fix phrase
he took children type peopl tri become
he held exampl elders i alway thought chief use children perfect use
dant describ soul man come hand god weep laugh like littl child christ also saw soul one a guisa di fanciulla che piangendo e ridendo pargoleggia
he felt life changeful fluid active allow stereotyp form death
he saw peopl serious material common interests unpract great thing one bother much affairs
the bird didnt man
he charm says take thought morrow soul meat
bodi raiment
 a greek might use latter phrase
it full greek feeling
but christ could said both sum life perfect us
his moral sympathy moral be
if thing ever said been her sin forgiven love much would worth die said it
his justic poetic justice exact justic be
the beggar goe heaven unhappy
i cannot conceiv better reason sent there
the peopl work hour vineyard cool even receiv much reward toil day long hot sun
whi shouldnt they
probabl one deserv anything
or perhap differ kind people
christ patienc dull lifeless mechan system treat peopl things treat everybodi alike laws except merely anybody anything matter like aught
that keynot romant art proper basi natur life
he saw basis
and brought one taken act sin show sentenc written law ask done wrote finger ground though hear them finally press again
 it worth live said that
like poetic natur love ignor people
he knew soul one ignor alway room great idea
but could stand stupid people especi made stupid education peopl full opinion one even understand peculiar modern type sum christ describ type one
his chief war philistines
that war everi child light wage
philistin note age communiti lived
in heavi inaccess ideas dull respectability tedious orthodoxy worship vulgar success entir preoccup gross materialist side life ridicul estim
christ mock white sepulchr respectability fix phrase ever
he treat world success thing absolut despised
he saw noth all
he look wealth encumbr man
he would hear life sacrif system thought morals
he point form ceremoni made man man form ceremonies
he took sabbatarian type thing set nought
the cold philanthropies ostentati public charities tedious formal dear middleclass mind expos utter relentless scorn
to us term orthodoxi mere facil unintellig acquiescence them hands terribl paralys tyranny

it seem danger idea
it isal great idea dangerous
that christ creed admit doubt
that true creed i dont doubt myself
of cours sinner must repent
but why
simpli otherwis would unabl realis done
the moment repent moment initiation
more that mean one alter one past
the greek thought impossible
they often say gnomic aphorisms even god cannot alter past

he told wicked laugh answer wick peopl alway old ugly
what laugh had
just like thrush singing
and pretti cotton dress larg hats
she knew nothing everyth lost
when reach home found servant wait him
he sent bed threw sofa library began think thing lord henri said him
was realli true one could never change
he felt wild long unstain puriti boyhoodhi rosewhit boyhood lord henri call it
he knew tarnish himself fill mind corrupt given horror fancy evil influenc others experienc terribl joy so live cross own
but irretrievable
was hope him
ah
monstrous moment pride passion pray portrait bear burden days keep unsulli splendour etern youth
all failur due that
better sin life brought sure swift penalti along it

the curious carv mirror lord henri given him mani year ago now stand table whitelimb cupid laugh round old
he took up done night horror first note chang fatal picture wild teardim eye look polish shield
once one terribl love written mad letter end idolatr words the world chang made ivori gold
the curv lip rewrit history
the phrase came back memory repeat himself
then loath beauty fling mirror floor crush silver splinter beneath heel
it beauti ruin him beauti youth pray for
but two things life might free stain
his beauti mask youth mockery
what youth best
a green unrip time time shallow moods sick thoughts
whi worn livery

jame vane hidden nameless grave selbi churchyard
alan campbel shot one night laboratory reveal secret forc know
the excitement was basil hallward disappear would soon pass away
it alreadi waning
he perfect safe there
nor indeed death basil hallward weigh upon mind
it live death soul troubl him
basil paint portrait mar life
he could forgiv that
it portrait done everything
basil said thing unbearable yet born patience
the murder simpli mad moment
as alan campbell suicid act
he chosen it

he could see change save eye look cun mouth curv wrinkl hypocrite
the thing still loathsomemor loathsome possible beforeand scarlet dew spot hand seem brighter like blood newli spilled
then trembled
had mere vaniti made one good deed
or desir new sensation lord henri hinted mock laugh
or passion act part sometim make us thing finer ourselves
or perhaps these
and red stain larger been
it seem crept like horribl diseas wrinkl fingers
there blood paint feet though thing drippedblood even hand held knife

to give put death
he laughed
he felt idea monstrous
besides even confess would believ him
there trace murder man anywhere
everyth belong destroyed
he burn belowstairs
the world would simpli say mad
they would shut persist story
yet duti confess suffer public shame make public atonement
there god call upon men tell sin earth well heaven
noth could would cleans till told sin
