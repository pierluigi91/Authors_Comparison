on night captur aneur burst found morn stretch upon floor cell placid smile upon face though abl die moment look back upon use life work
gregson lestrad wild death holm remarked chat next evening
where grand advertis now
i dont see much capture i answered
what world matter consequence return companion bitterly
the question is make peopl believ done
never mind continued brightly pause
i would miss investig anything
there better case within recollection
simpl was sever instruct point it
simple
i ejaculated
well really hard describ otherwise said sherlock holmes smile surprise
the proof intrins simplic is without help save ordinari deduct i abl lay hand upon crimin within three days
that true said i i alreadi explain common usual guid rather hindrance
in solv problem sort grand thing abl reason backwards
that use accomplishment easi one peopl practis much
in everyday affair life use reason forwards come neglected
there fifti reason synthet one reason analytically
i confess said i that i quit follow you
i hard expect would
let see i make clearer
most people describ train event them tell result would be
they put event togeth minds argu someth come pass
there people however who told result would abl evolv inner conscious step led result
this power i mean i talk reason backwards analytically
i understand said i now case given result find everyth els yourself
now let endeavour show differ step reasoning
to begin beginning
i approach house know foot mind entir free impressions
i natur began examin roadway there i alreadi explain you i saw clear mark cab which i ascertain inquiry must night
i satisfi cab privat carriag narrow gaug wheels
the ordinari london growler consider less wide gentleman brougham
this first point gained
i walk slowli garden path happen compos clay soil peculiar suitabl take impressions
no doubt appear mere trampl line slush train eye everi mark upon surfac meaning

happily i alway laid great stress upon it much practic made second natur me

men die heart disease sudden natur cause never chanc exhibit agit upon features
have snif dead man lip i detect slight sour smell i came conclus poison forc upon him
again i argu forc upon hatr fear express upon face
by method exclusion i arriv result hypothesi would meet facts
do imagin unheard idea
the forcibl administr poison mean new thing crimin annals
the case dolski odessa leturi montpellier occur toxicologist
and came great question reason why
robberi object murder noth taken
was politics then woman
that question confront me
i inclin first latter supposition
polit assassin glad work fly
this murder had contrary done deliberately perpetr left track room show time
it must privat wrong polit one call method revenge
when inscript discov upon wall i inclin ever opinion
the thing evid blind
when ring found however settl question
clear murder use remind victim dead absent woman
it point i ask gregson whether enquir telegram cleveland particular point mr drebber former career
he answered remember negative
i proceed make care examin room confirm opinion murder height furnish addit detail trichinopoli cigar length nails
i alreadi come conclusion sinc sign struggle blood cover floor burst murder nose excitement
i could perceiv track blood coincid track feet
it seldom man unless fullblooded break way emotion i hazard opinion crimin probabl robust ruddyfac man

i telegraph head polic cleveland limit enquiri circumst connect marriag enoch drebber
the answer conclusive
it told drebber alreadi appli protect law old rival love name jefferson hope hope present europe

i alreadi determin mind man walk hous drebber none man driven cab
the mark road show hors wander way would imposs anyon charg it
where then could driver be unless insid house
again absurd suppos sane man would carri deliber crime eyes were third person sure betray him
lastly suppos one man wish dog anoth london better mean could adopt turn cabdriver
all consider led irresist conclus jefferson hope found among jarvey metropolis
if one reason believ ceas be
on contrary point view sudden chang would like draw attent himself
he would probably time least continu perform duties
there reason suppos go assum name
whi chang name countri one knew origin one
i therefor organ street arab detect corps sent systemat everi cab proprietor london ferret man i wanted
how well succeeded quick i took advantag it still fresh recollection
the murder stangerson incid entir unexpected could hard case prevented
through it know i came possess pills exist i alreadi surmised
you see whole thing chain logic sequenc without break flaw
it wonderful
i cried
your merit public recognized

on one whimsic littl incid happen four million human be jostl within space squar miles
amid action reaction dens swarm humanity everi possibl combin event may expect take place mani littl problem present may strike bizarr without criminal
we alreadi experi such
so much so i remarked that last six case i ad notes three entir free legal crime
precisely
you allud attempt recov iren adler papers singular case miss mari sutherland adventur man twist lip
well i doubt small matter fall innoc category
you know peterson commissionaire
yes
it trophi belongs
it hat
no no found it
it owner unknown
i beg look upon batter billycock intellectu problem
and first came here
it arriv upon christma morning compani good fat goose is i doubt roast moment front peterson fire
the fact these four oclock christma morning peterson who know honest fellow return small jollif make way homeward tottenham court road
in front saw gaslight tallish man walk slight stagger carri white goos slung shoulder
as reach corner goodg street row broke stranger littl knot roughs

what then peterson do
he brought round hat goos christma morning know even smallest problem interest me
the goos retain morning sign that spite slight frost would well eaten without unnecessari delay
it finder carri off therefore fulfil ultim destini goose i continu retain hat unknown gentleman lost christma dinner
did advertise
no
then clue could identity
on much deduce
from hat
precisely
but joking
what gather old batter felt
here lens
you know methods
what gather individu man worn article
i took tatter object hand turn rather ruefully
it ordinari black hat usual round shape hard much wors wear
the line red silk good deal discoloured

b scrawl upon one side
it pierc brim hatsecurer elast missing

i see nothing said i hand back friend
on contrary watson see everything
you fail however reason see
you timid draw inferences
then pray tell infer hat
he pick gaze peculiar introspect fashion characterist him
it perhap less suggest might been remarked and yet infer distinct other repres least strong balanc probability
that man high intellectu cours obvious upon face it also fair welltodo within last three years although fallen upon evil days
he foresight less formerly point moral retrogression which taken declin fortunes seem indic evil influence probabl drink work upon him
this may account also obvious fact wife ceas love him

he has however retain degre selfrespect continued disregard remonstrance
he man lead sedentari life goe little train entirely middleaged grizzl hair cut within last days anoint limecream
these patent fact deduc hat
also way extrem improb gas laid house
you certain joking holmes
not least
is possibl even now i give results unabl see attained

then could hope deed done slip quick window wade moat get away leisure
that understandable
but understand go way bring noisi weapon could select know well fetch everi human hous spot quick run odd
is credible mr holmes
well put case strongly friend repli thoughtfully
it certain need good deal justification
may i ask mr white mason whether examin farther side moat see sign man climb water

at time mr white mason i claim right work way give result timecomplet rather stages
i sure honour presenc show know said white mason cordially
come along dr watson time come well hope place book
we walk quaint villag street row pollard elm side it
just beyond two ancient stone pillars weatherstain lichenblotched bear upon summit shapeless someth rampant lion capus birlstone
a short walk along wind drive sward oak around one see rural england sudden turn long low jacobean hous dingy livercolour brick lay us oldfashion garden cut yew

and yet strange peak roof quaint overhung gabl fit cover grim terribl intrigue
as i look deepset window long sweep dullcoloured waterlap front i felt fit scene could set tragedy
that window said white mason that one immedi right drawbridge
it open found last night
it look rather narrow man pass
well wasnt fat man anyhow
we dont need deductions mr holmes tell us that

holm walk edg moat look across
then examin stone ledg grass border beyond it
iv good look mr holmes said white mason
there noth there sign anyon landedbut leav sign
exactly
whi he
is water alway turbid
gener colour

how deep it
about two feet side three middle
so put asid idea man drown crossing
no child could drown it
we walk across drawbridge admit quaint gnarled driedup person butler ames
the poor old fellow white quiver shock
the villag sergeant tall formal melancholi man still held vigil room fate
the doctor departed
anyth fresh sergeant wilson
ask white mason

then go home
youv enough

the butler better wait outside
tell warn mr cecil barker mrs douglas housekeep may want word presently
now gentlemen perhap allow give view i form first abl arriv own
he impress me countri specialist
he solid grip fact cool clear commonsens brain take way profession
holm listen intently sign impati offici expon often produced
is suicide murderthat first question gentlemen not
if suicide believ man began take wed ring conceal it came dress gown trampl mud corner behind curtain order give idea someon wait
so i think
suicid question
then murder done
what determin is whether done someon outsid insid house
well let hear argument
there consider difficulti ways yet one must be
we suppos first person person insid hous crime
they got man time everyth still yet one asleep
they deed queerest noisiest weapon world tell everyon happeneda weapon never seen hous before
that seem like start it
no not
well then everyon agre alarm given minut pass whole householdnot mr cecil barker alone though claim first ame spot
do tell time guilti person manag make footmark corner open window mark sill blood take wed ring dead man finger rest it
it impossible
you put clearly said holmes
i inclin agre you
well then driven back theori done someon outside
we still face big difficulties anyhow ceas impossibilities
the man got hous fourthirti six say dusk time bridg raised
there visitors door open noth prevent him
he may common burglar may privat grudg mr douglas
sinc mr dougla spent life america shotgun seem american weapon would seem privat grudg like theory
he slip room first came to hid behind curtain
there remain past eleven night
at time mr dougla enter room
it short interview interview all mrs dougla declar husband left minut heard shot
the candl show that said holmes
exactly
the candle new one burn half inch
he must place tabl attacked otherwise course would fallen fell

well now reconstruct thing lines
mr dougla enter room
he put candle
a man appear behind curtain
he arm gun
he demand wed ringheaven know why must been
mr dougla gave up
then either cold blood cours struggledougla may grip hammer found upon math shot dougla horribl way
he drop gun also would seem queer cardvv  whatev may meanand made escap window across moat moment cecil barker discov crime
how that mr holmes
veri interesting littl unconvincing
man would absolut nonsens wasnt anyth els even worse
cri macdonald
somebodi kill man whoever i could clear prove done way
what mean allow retreat cut like that
what mean use shotgun silenc one chanc escape
come mr holmes it give us lead sinc say mr white mason theori unconvincing

the mere sight excel appetit assur success i clear recollect day night without thought food baffl mind chafe problem thin eager featur becam
final lit pipe sit inglenook old villag inn talk slowli random case rather one think aloud one make consid statement
a lie watsona great big thumping obtrusive uncompromis liethat meet us threshold
there start point
the whole stori told barker lie
but barker stori corrobor mrs douglas
therefor lie also
they lying conspiracy
so clear problem
whi lying truth tri hard conceal
let us try watson i get behind lie reconstruct truth
how i know lying
becaus clumsi fabric simpli could true
consider
accord stori given us assassin less minut murder commit take ring anoth ring dead man finger replac ringa thing would sure never
i say obvious impossible
you may arguebut i much respect judgment watson think sothat ring may taken man killed
the fact candl lit short time show lengthi interview
was douglas hear fearless character man would like give wed ring short notice could conceiv give all
no no watson assassin alon dead man time lamp lit
of i doubt all
but gunshot appar caus death
therefor shot must fire time earlier told
but could mistak matter that
we presence therefore deliber conspiraci upon part two peopl heard gunshotof man barker woman douglas
when top i abl show blood mark windowsil deliber place barker order give fals clue police admit case grow dark him
now ask hour murder actual occur
up halfpast ten servant move house certain time
at quarter eleven gone room except ames pantry
i tri experi left us afternoon i find nois macdonald make studi penetr pantri door shut
it otherwise however housekeep room
it far corridor i could vagu hear voic loud raised
the sound shotgun extent muffl discharg close range undoubt instance
it would loud yet silenc night easili penetr mrs allen room
she is told us somewhat deaf none less mention evid hear someth like door slam half hour alarm given
half hour alarm given would quarter eleven
i doubt heard report gun real instant murder
if so determin barker mrs douglas presum actual murderers could quarter eleven sound shot brought down quarter past eleven rang
what doing instant give alarm
that question face us answer shall sure gone way solv problem
i convinc myself said i that understand two people
she must heartless creatur sit laugh jest within hour husband murder
exactly
she shine wife even account occurred
i wholesoul admir womankind aware watson experi life taught wives regard husbands would let man spoken word stand husband dead
should i ever marry watson i hope inspir wife feel would prevent walk housekeep corps lie within yard her
it bad stagemanaged even rawest investig must struck absenc usual feminin ululation
if noth else incid alon would suggest prearrang conspiraci mind
you think then definitely barker mrs dougla guilti murder
there appal direct questions watson said holmes shake pipe me
they come like bullets
if put mrs dougla barker know truth murder conspir conceal it i give wholesoul answer
i sure do
but dead proposit clear
let us moment consid difficulti stand way
we suppos coupl unit bond guilti love determin get rid man stand them
it larg supposition discreet inquiri among servant other fail corrobor way
on contrary good deal evid douglas attach other
that i sure cannot true said i think beauti smile face garden
well least gave impression
however suppos extraordinarili astut couple deceiv everyon upon point conspir murder husband
he happen man whose head danger hangs we word that
holm look thoughtful
i see watson
you sketch theori everyth say begin false
accord idea never hidden menace secret society valley fear boss macsomebody anyth else
well good sweep generalization
let us see bring us to
they invent theori account crime
they play idea leav bicycl park proof exist outsider
the stain windowsil convey idea
so card body might prepar house
that fit hypothesis watson
but come nasty angular uncompromis bit wont slip places
whi cutoff shotgun weaponsand american one that
how could sure sound would bring someon them
it mere chanc mrs allen start inquir slam door
whi guilti coupl this watson
i confess i cant explain it
then again woman lover conspir murder husband go advertis guilt ostentati remov wed ring death
doe strike probable watson
no not
and again thought leav bicycl conceal outsid occur you would realli seem worth dullest detect would natur say obvious blind bicycl first thing
i conceiv explanation
and yet combin event wit man cannot conceiv explanation
simpli mental exercise without assert true let indic possibl line thought
it is i admit mere imagination often imagin mother truth
we suppos guilti secret realli shame secret life man douglas
this lead murder someon is suppose avenger someon outside
this avenger reason i confess i still loss explain took dead man wed ring
the vendetta might conceiv date back man first marriage ring taken reason
befor aveng got away barker wife reach room
the assassin convinc attempt arrest would lead public hideous scandal
they convert idea prefer let go
for purpos probabl lower bridge done quit noiselessly rais again
he made escape reason thought could safe foot bicycle
he therefor left machin would discov got safe away
so far within bound possibility not
well possible doubt said i reserve
we remember watson whatev occur certain someth extraordinary
well now continu supposititi case couplenot necessarili guilti coupler murder gone place posit may difficult prove
they rapid rather clumsili met situation
the mark put barker bloodstain slipper upon windowsil suggest fugit got away
they obvious two must heard sound gun gave alarm exact would done good half hour event
