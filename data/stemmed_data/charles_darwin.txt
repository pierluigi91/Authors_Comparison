when board hms beagle naturalist i much struck certain fact distribut inhabit south america geolog relat present past inhabit continent

when look individu varieti subvarieti older cultiv plant animals one first point strike us is general differ much other individu one speci
when reflect vast divers plant anim cultivated vari age differ climat treatment i think driven conclud greater variabl simpli due
there is also i think probabl view propound andrew knight variabl may part connect excess food
it seem pretti clear organ be must expos sever generat new condit life caus appreci amount variation organis begun vary general continu vari mani
no case record variabl ceas variabl cultivation
our oldest cultiv plants wheat still often yield new varieties oldest domest anim still capabl rapid improv modification
it disput period life caus variability whatev may be general act whether earli late period develop embryo instant conception
geoffroy st hilair experi show unnatur treatment embryo caus monstrosities monstros cannot separ clear line distinct mere variations
but i strong inclin suspect frequent caus variabl may attribut male femal reproduct element affect prior act conception
sever reason make believ this chief one remark effect confin cultiv function reproduct system system appear far suscept part organisation
noth easi tame animal thing difficult get breed freeli confinement even mani case male femal unite
how mani anim breed though live long close confin nativ country
this general attribut vitiat instincts mani cultiv plant display utmost vigour yet rare never seed
in case found trifl changes littl less water particular period growth determin whether plant set seed
i cannot enter copious detail i collect curious subject show singular law determin reproduct anim confinement i may mention carnivor animals even
mani exot plant pollen utter worthless exact condit steril hybrids
when one hand see domest anim plants though often weak sickly yet breed quit freeli confinement when hand see individuals though taken young state nature perfect tamed
steril said bane horticulture view owe variabl caus produc sterility variabl sourc choicest product garden
i may add organ breed freeli unnatur condit for instance rabbit ferret kept hutches show reproduct system thus affected anim plant withstand
a long list could easili given sport plants term garden mean singl bud offset sudden assum new sometim differ charact rest plant
such bud propag grafting etc
 sometim seed
these sports extrem rare nature far rare cultivation case see treatment parent affect bud offset ovul pollen
but opinion physiologist essenti differ bud ovul earliest stage formation that fact sports support view variabl may larg attribut ovul
these case anyhow show variat necessarili connected author supposed act generation
seedl fruit young litter sometim differ consider other though young parents muller remarked appar expos exact condit life
to judg much case variation attribut direct action heat moisture light food etc
 difficult impress is anim agenc produc littl direct effect though appar case plants
under point view mr buckman recent experi plant seem extrem valuable
when near individu expos certain condit affect way chang first appear direct due conditions case shown quit opposit condit produc similar chang
nevertheless slight amount chang may i think attribut direct action condit lifeas cases increas size amount food colour particular kind food light perhap thick
habit also decid influence period flower plant transport one climat another
in anim mark effect instance i find domest duck bone wing weigh less bone leg more proport whole skeleton bone wildduck i presum
the great inherit develop udder cow goat countri habitu milked comparison state organ countries anoth instanc effect use

hence man goe selecting thus augmenting peculiarity almost certain unconsci modifi part structure owe mysteri law correl growth
the result various quit unknown dim seen law variat infinit complex diversified
it well worth care studi sever treatis publish old cultiv plants hyacinth potato even dahlia etc
 realli surpris note endless point structur constitut varieti subvarieti differ slight other
the whole organis seem becom plastic tend depart small degre parent type
ani variat inherit unimport us
but number divers inherit deviat structure slight consider physiolog importance endless
dr prosper luca treatise two larg volumes fullest best subject
no breeder doubt strong tendenc inheritance like produc like fundament belief doubt thrown principl theoret writer alone
when deviat appear unfrequently see father child cannot tell whether may due origin caus act both amongst individuals appar expos conditions rare
everi one must heard case albinism prick skin hairi bodies etc
 appear sever member family
if strang rare deviat structur truli inherited less strang common deviat may freeli admit inheritable
perhap correct way view whole subject would be look inherit everi charact whatev rule noninherit anomaly
the law govern inherit quit unknown one say peculiar differ individu species individu differ species sometim inherit sometim so child often revert
it fact littl import us peculiar appear male domest breed often transmit either exclusively much greater degree male alone
a much import rule i think may trusted that whatev period life peculiar first appears tend appear offspr correspond age though sometim earlier
in mani case could otherwise thus inherit peculiar horn cattl could appear offspr near mature peculiar silkworm known appear correspond caterpillar cocoon stage
but hereditari diseas fact make believ rule wider extension appar reason peculiar appear particular age yet tend appear offspr
i believ rule highest import explain law embryology
these remark cours confin first appear peculiarity primari cause may act ovul male element near manner cross offspr shorthorn cow
have allud subject reversion i may refer statement often made naturalistsnamely domest varieties run wild gradual certain revert charact aborigin stocks
henc argu deduct drawn domest race speci state nature
i vain endeavour discov decis fact statement often bold made
there would great difficulti prove truth may safe conclud mani stronglymark domest varieti could possibl live wild state
in mani case know aborigin stock was could tell whether near perfect revers ensued
it would quit necessary order prevent effect intercrossing singl varieti turn loos new home
nevertheless varieti certain occasion revert charact ancestr forms seem improbable could succeed naturalising cultivate mani generations sever races
whether experi would succeed great import line argument experi condit life changed
if could shown domest varieti manifest strong tendenc reversionthat is lose acquir characters whilst kept unchang conditions whilst kept consider body free intercross might check
but shadow evid favour view assert could breed cart racehorses long shorthorn cattle poultri various breeds escul vegetables almost infinit number generations
i may add natur condit life change variat revers charact probabl occur natur selection hereaft explained determin far new charact thus aris shall preserved
when look hereditari varieti race domest anim plants compar speci close alli together general perceiv domest race alreadi remarked less uniform charact true
domest race species also often somewhat monstrous character i mean that although differ other speci genus sever trifl respects often differ extrem
with except and perfect fertil varieti crosseda subject hereaft discussed domest race speci differ manner as case lesser degre than
i think must admitted find hard domest races either amongst anim plants rank compet judg mere varieties compet judg descend aborigin
if mark distinct exist domest race species sourc doubt could perpetu recur
it often state domest race differ charact generic value
i think could shown statement hard correct naturalist differ wide determin charact generic value valuat present empirical
moreover view origin genera i shall present give right expect often meet generic differ domest productions
when attempt estim amount structur differ domest race species soon involv doubt know whether descend one sever parentspecies
this point could clear up would interesting if instance could shown greyhound bloodhound terrier spaniel bulldog know propag kind truly offspr singl species
i believe shall present see dog descend one wild species but case domest races presumptive even strong evid favour view
it often assum man chosen domest anim plant extraordinari inher tendenc vary likewis withstand divers climates
i disput capac ad larg valu domest productions could savag possibl know first tame animal whether would vari succeed generations whether would
has littl variabl ass guineafowl small power endur warmth reindeer cold common camel prevent domestication
i cannot doubt anim plants equal number domest productions belong equal divers class countries taken state nature could made breed equal number generat
in case ancient domest anim plants i think possibl come definit conclusion whether descend one sever species
the argument main reli believ multipl origin domest anim is find ancient records especi monument egypt much divers breeds breed close
even latter fact found strict general true seem case show breed origin there four five thousand year ago
but mr horner research render degre probabl man suffici civil manufactur potteri exist valley nile thirteen fourteen thousand year ago pretend say long
the whole subject must i think remain vague nevertheless i may without enter details state that geograph considerations i think high probabl domest dog descend sever wild species
in regard sheep goat i form opinion
i think fact communic mr blyth habits voice constitution etc
 hump indian cattle descend differ aborigin stock european cattle sever compet judg believ latter one wild parent
with respect horses reason i cannot give here i doubt inclin believe opposit sever authors race descend one wild stock
mr blyth whose opinion larg vari store knowledge i valu almost one think breed poultri proceed common wild indian fowl gallus bankiva
in regard duck rabbits breed differ consider structure i doubt descend common wild duck rabbit
the doctrin origin sever domest race sever aborigin stocks carri absurd extrem authors
they believ everi race breed true let distinct charact ever slight wild prototype
at rate must exist least score speci wild cattle mani sheep sever goat europ alone sever even within great britain
one author believ former exist great britain eleven wild speci sheep peculiar it
when bear mind britain hard one peculiar mammal franc distinct germani conversely hungary spain etc
 kingdom possess sever peculiar breed cattle sheep etc

so india
even case domest dog whole world i fulli admit probabl descend sever wild species i cannot doubt immens amount inherit variation

if however isol area small either surround barriers peculiar physic conditions total number individu support necessarili small few individu

but may thus great deceiv ourselves ascertain whether small isol area larg open area like continent favour product new organ forms ought make comparison within equal times

each new form also soon much improved abl spread open continu area thus come competit mani others
henc new place formed competit fill severe larg small isol area
moreover great areas though continuous owe oscil level often recent exist broken condition good effect isol generally certain extent concurred
finally i conclud that although small isol area probabl respect high favour product new species yet cours modif general rapid larg areas
we can perhaps views understand fact allud chapter geograph distribution instance product smaller contin australia former yielded appar
thus also continent product everywher becom larg naturalis islands

thus i believe natur select alway succeed long run reduc save everi part organisation soon render superfluous without mean caus part larg develop correspond

now let us turn nature

the principl includ remark may extended

in connexion present subject i make two remarks
i think admitted without enter details secondari sexual charact variable i think also admit speci group differ wide secondari sexual characters
the caus origin variabl secondari sexual charact manifest see charact render constant uniform part organisation secondari sexual charact
whatev caus may variabl secondari sexual characters high variable sexual select wide scope action may thus readili succeed give speci group greater
it remark fact secondari sexual differ two sex speci general display part organis differ speci genus differ other
of fact i give illustr two instances first happen stand list differ case unusu nature relat hard accidental

this relat clear mean view subject i look speci genus certain descend progenitor two sex one species

finally then i conclud greater variabl specif characters distinguish speci species generic characters speci possess commonthat frequent extrem variabl part
all main due speci group descend common progenitor inherit much commonto part recent larg vari like still go vari part
distinct speci present analog variations and a varieti of one speci often assum some of the charact of an alli species or revert to some of the charact of an earli progenitor

we may i think confid come conclusion because seen colour mark emin liabl appear cross offspr two distinct differ colour breeds case noth extern
no doubt surpris fact charact reappear lost many perhap hundr generations
but breed cross breed offspr occasion show tendenc revert charact foreign breed mani generationssom say dozen even score generations
after twelv generations proport blood use common expression one ancestor   yet see general believ tendenc revers retain small proport foreign blood
in breed crossed both parent lost charact progenitor possessed tendency whether strong weak reproduc lost charact might be former remarked see
when charact lost breed reappear great number generations probabl hypothesi is offspr sudden take ancestor hundr generat distant success
for instance probabl generat barbpigeon produc rare blue blackbar bird tendenc generat plumag assum colour
this view hypothetical could support facts i see abstract improb tendenc produc charact inherit endless number generations quit useless rudimentari organ being
indeed may sometim observ mere tendenc produc rudiment inherited instance common snapdragon antirrhinum rudiment fifth stamen often appears plant must inherit tendenc produc it
as speci genus supposed theory descend common parent might expect would occasion vari analog manner varieti one speci would resembl

it might expect speci genus would occasion exhibit revers lost ancestr characters
as however never know exact charact common ancestor group could distinguish two cases if instance know rockpigeon featherfoot turncrowned could told whether

the subject instinct might work previous chapters i thought would conveni treat subject separately especi wonder instinct hivebe make cell probabl
i must premise i noth origin primari mental powers i life itself
we concern divers instinct mental qualiti anim within class
i attempt definit instinct
it would easi show sever distinct mental action common embrac term everi one understand meant said instinct impel cuckoo migrat lay egg bird nests
an action requir experi enabl us perform perform animal especi young one without experience perform mani individu way without know
but i could show none charact instinct universal
a littl dose pierr huber express it judgment reason often come play even anim low scale nature
frederick cuvier sever older metaphysician compar instinct habit
this comparison gives i think remark accur notion frame mind instinct action performed origin
how unconsci mani habitu action performed inde rare direct opposit conscious will
yet may modifi reason
habit easili becom associ habits certain period time state body
when acquired often remain constant throughout life
sever point resembl instinct habit could point out
as repeat wellknown song instincts one action follow anoth sort rhythm person interrupt song repeat anyth rote general forc go back recov habitu train thought p
if however caterpillar taken hammock made up instance third stage put one finish sixth stage much work alreadi done it far feel benefit this much
if suppos habitu action becom inheritedand i think shown sometim happenthen resembl origin habit instinct becom close distinguished
if mozart instead play pianofort three year old wonder littl practice play tune practic all might truli said done instinctively
but would serious error suppos greater number instinct acquir habit one generation transmit inherit succeed generations
it clear shown wonder instinct acquainted namely hivebe mani ants could possibl thus acquired
it univers admit instinct import corpor structur welfar species present condit life
under chang condit life least possibl slight modif instinct might profit species shown instinct vari ever little i see difficulti natur select preserv
it thus i believe complex wonder instinct originated
as modif corpor structur aris from increas by use habit diminish lost disuse i doubt instincts
but i believ effect habit quit subordin import effect natur select may call accident variat instinctsthat variat produc unknown caus produc slight
no complex instinct possibl produc natur selection except slow gradual accumul numerous slight yet profitable variations
hence case corpor structures ought find nature actual transit gradat complex instinct acquiredfor could found lineal ancestor speciesbut ought find
i surpris find make allow instinct anim littl observ except europ north america instinct known amongst extinct species general gradations lead
the canon natura non facit saltum appli almost equal forc instinct bodili organs
chang instinct may sometim facilit speci differ instinct differ period life differ season year place differ circumstances etc
 case either one instinct might preserv natur selection
and instanc divers instinct speci shown occur nature
again case corpor structure conform theory instinct speci good itself never far judge produc exclus good others
one strongest instanc anim appar perform action sole good another i acquainted aphid voluntarili yield sweet excret ants voluntarily follow fact

even quit young aphid behav manner show action instinctive result experience
but excret extrem viscid probabl conveni aphid removed therefor probabl aphid instinct excret sole good ants
although i believ anim world perform action exclus good anoth distinct species yet speci tri take advantag instinct others take advantag weaker bodili structur
so again cases certain instinct cannot consid absolut perfect detail point indispensable may pass over
as degre variat instinct state nature inherit variations indispens action natur selection mani instanc possibl ought given want space prevent me

the subject well deserv discuss great length i take singl case work steril ants
how worker render steril difficulty much greater strike modif structure shown insect articul anim state natur occasion becom sterile
but i must pass preliminari difficulty
the great difficulti lie work ant differ wide male fertil femal structure shape thorax destitut wing sometim eyes instinct
as far instinct alon concerned prodigi differ respect worker perfect females would far better exemplifi hivebee
if work ant neuter insect anim ordinari state i unhesit assum charact slowli acquir natur selection namely individu born slight
but work ant insect differ great parents yet absolut sterile could never transmit success acquir modif structur instinct progeny
it may well ask possibl reconcil case theori natur selection
first let rememb innumer instances domest product state nature sort differ structur becom correl certain ages either sex
we differ correl one sex short period alon reproduct system active nuptial plumag mani birds hook jaw male salmon

thus i believ social insects slight modif structure instinct correl steril condit certain member community advantag community consequ fertil male femal

summary
the view general entertain naturalist species intercrossed special endow qualiti sterility order prevent confus organ forms
this view certain seem first probable speci within countri could hard kept distinct capabl cross freely
the import fact hybrid general sterile has i think much underr late writers
on theori natur select case especi important inasmuch steril hybrid could possibl advantag them therefor could acquir continu preserv success profit
i hope however abl show steril special acquir endow quality incident acquir differences
in treat subject two class facts larg extent fundament different general confound together namely steril two speci first crossed steril hybrid produc them
pure speci cours organ reproduct perfect condition yet intercross produc either offspring
hybrids hand reproduct organ function impotent may clear seen state male element plant animals though organ perfect structure far microscop reveals
in first case two sexual element go form embryo perfect second case either developed imperfect developed
this distinct important caus sterility common two cases considered
the distinct probabl slur over owe steril case look special endowment beyond provinc reason powers
the fertil varieties form known believ descend common parents intercrossed likewis fertil mongrel offspring is theory equal import steril species
first steril speci cross hybrid offspring
it imposs studi sever memoir work two conscienti admir observers kolreut gartner almost devot live subject without deepli impress high general degre
kolreut make rule universal cut knot ten case found two forms consid author distinct species quit fertil together unhesit rank varieties
gartner also make rule equal universal disput entir fertil kolreut ten cases
but mani cases gartner oblig care count seeds order show degre sterility
he alway compar maximum number seed produc two speci cross hybrid offspring averag number produc pure parentspeci state nature
but serious caus error seem introduced plant hybridis must castrated and often important must seclud order prevent pollen brought insect plants
near plant experimentis gartner potted appar kept chamber house
that process often injuri fertil plant cannot doubted gartner give tabl score case plant castrated artifici fertilis pollen exclud case
moreover gartner sever year repeat cross primros cowslip good reason believ varieties twice succeed get fertil seed found common red blue pimpernel
it certain one hand steril various speci cross differ degre graduat away insensibly and hand fertil pure speci easili affect various circumstances
i think better evid requir two experienc observ ever lived namely kolreut gartner arriv diametr opposit conclus regard species
it also instruct comparebut i space enter detailsth evid advanc best botanist question whether certain doubt form rank speci varieties evid fertil
it thus shown neither steril fertil afford clear distinct speci varieties evid sourc graduat away doubt degre evid deriv
in regard steril hybrid success generations though gartner enabl rear hybrids care guard cross either pure parent six seven one case ten generations yet assert posit
i doubt usual case fertil often sudden decreas first generations
nevertheless i believ experi fertil diminish independ cause namely close interbreeding
i collect larg bodi facts show close interbreed lessen fertility and hand occasion cross distinct individu varieti increas fertility i cannot doubt correct almost
hybrid seldom rais experimentalist great numbers parentspecies alli hybrids general grow garden visit insect must care prevent flower season henc hybrid
i strengthen convict remark statement repeat made gartner namely even less fertil hybrid artifici fertilis hybrid pollen kind fertility notwithstand frequent ill
now artifici fertilis pollen often taken chanc as i know experience anther anoth flower anther flower fertilised cross two flowers though
moreover whenev complic experi progress care observ gartner would castrat hybrids would insur generat cross pollen distinct flower either plant
and thus strang fact increas fertil success generat artifici fertilis hybrid may i believe account close interbreed avoided
now let us turn result arriv third experienc hybridiser namely honour reverend w herbert
he emphat conclus hybrid perfect fertilea fertil pure parentspeciesa kolreut gartner degre steril distinct speci univers law nature
he experimentis speci gartner
the differ result may i think part account herbert great horticultur skill hothous command
of mani import statement i give singl one example namely everi ovul pod crinum capens fertilis c revolutum produc plant he says i never saw occur case natur fecundation
so perfect even common perfect fertil first cross two distinct species
this case crinum lead refer singular fact namely individu plants certain speci lobelia speci genus hippeastrum far easili fertilis pollen
for plant found yield seed pollen distinct species though quit steril pollen notwithstand pollen found perfect good fertilis distinct species
so certain individu plant individu certain speci actual hybridis much readili selffertilised
for instance bulb hippeastrum aulicum produc four flowers three fertilis herbert pollen fourth subsequ fertilis pollen compound hybrid descend three distinct species
in letter me  mr herbert told tri experi five years continu tri sever subsequ years alway result
this result has also confirm observ case hippeastrum subgenera case genera lobelia passiflora verbascum
although plant experi appear perfect healthy although ovul pollen flower perfect good respect species yet function imperfect mutual selfaction must
nevertheless fact show slight mysteri caus lesser greater fertil speci crossed comparison speci selffertilised sometim depends
the practic experi horticulturists though made scientif precision deserv notice
it notori complic manner speci pelargonium fuchsia calceolaria petunia rhododendron etc
 crossed yet mani hybrid seed freely
for instance herbert assert hybrid calceolaria integrifolia plantaginea speci wide dissimilar general habit reproduc perfect natur speci mountain chile
i taken pain ascertain degre fertil complex cross rhododendrons i assur mani perfect fertile
mr c noble instance inform rais stock graft hybrid rhododendron ponticum catawbiense hybrid seed freeli possibl imagine
had hybrids fair treated gone decreas fertil success generation gartner believ case fact would notori nurserymen
horticulturist rais larg bed hybrids alon fair treated insect agenc sever individu hybrid varieti allow freeli cross other injuri influenc close interbreed
ani one may readili convinc effici insectag examin flower steril kind hybrid rhododendrons produc pollen find stigma plenti pollen brought flowers
in regard animals much fewer experi care tri plants
if systemat arrang trusted genera anim distinct other genera plants may infer anim wide separ scale natur easili cross
i doubt whether case perfect fertil hybrid anim consid thorough well authenticated
it should however born mind that owe anim breed freeli confinement experi fair tried instance canarybird cross nine finches one nine speci breed
again respect fertil success generat fertil hybrid animals i hard know instanc two famili hybrid rais time differ parents avoid ill
on contrary brother sister usual cross success generation opposit constant repeat admonit everi breeder
and case surpris inher steril hybrid gone increasing
if act thus pair brother sister case pure animal caus least tendenc sterility breed would assur lost generations
although i know thorough wellauthent case perfect fertil hybrid animals i reason believ hybrid cervulus vaginali reevesii phasianus colchicus p torquatus p
the hybrid common chines gees a
cygnoides speci differ general rank distinct genera often bred countri either pure parent one singl instanc bred inter se
this effect mr eyton rais two hybrid parent differ hatches two bird rais less eight hybrid grandchildren pure geese one nest
in india however crossbr gees must far fertile i assur two emin capabl judges name mr blyth capt
hutton whole flock cross gees kept various part country kept profit neither pure parentspeci exists must certain high fertile
a doctrin origin pallas larg accept modern naturalists namely domest anim descend two aborigin species sinc commingl intercrossing
on view aborigin speci must either first produc quit fertil hybrids hybrid must becom subsequ generat quit fertil domestication
this latter altern seem probable i inclin believ truth although rest direct evidence
i believe instance dog descend sever wild stocks yet perhap except certain indigen domest dog south america quit fertil together analog make great doubt whether sever
so reason believ european hump indian cattl quit fertil together fact communic mr blyth i think must consid distinct species
on view origin mani domest animals must either give belief almost univers steril distinct speci anim crossed must look sterility indel characteristic one
finally look ascertain fact intercross plant animals may conclud degre sterility first cross hybrids extrem general result cannot present state
law govern the steril of first cross and of hybrids
we consid littl detail circumst rule govern steril first cross hybrids
our chief object see whether rule indic speci special endow quality order prevent cross blend togeth utter confusion
the follow rule conclus chiefli drawn gartner admir work hybridis plants
i taken much pain ascertain far rule appli animals consid scanti knowledg regard hybrid animals i surpris find general rule appli kingdoms
it alreadi remarked degre fertility first cross hybrids graduat zero perfect fertility
it surpris mani curious way gradat shown exist barest outlin fact given
when pollen plant one famili place stigma plant distinct family exert influenc much inorgan dust
from absolut zero fertility pollen differ speci genus appli stigma one species yield perfect gradat number seed produced near complet even quit complet fertility and
so hybrid themselves never produced probabl never would produce even pollen either pure parent singl fertil seed case first trace fertil may detected pollen
from extrem degre steril selffertilis hybrid produc greater greater number seed perfect fertility
hybrid two speci difficult cross rare produc offspring general sterile parallel difficulti make first cross steril hybrid thus producedtwo class
there mani cases two pure speci unit unusu facility produc numer hybridoffspring yet hybrid remark sterile
on hand speci cross rarely extrem difficulty hybrids last produced fertile
even within limit genus instanc dianthus two opposit case occur
the fertility first cross hybrids easili affect unfavour conditions fertil pure species
but degre fertil likewis innat variable alway two speci cross circumstances depend part upon constitut individu happen chosen
so hybrids degre fertil often found differ great sever individu rais seed capsul expos exact conditions
by term systemat affin meant resembl speci structur constitution especi structur part high physiolog import differ littl alli species
now fertil first cross species hybrid produc them larg govern systemat affinity
this clear shown hybrid never rais speci rank systematist distinct families hand close alli speci general unit facility
but correspond systemat affin facil cross mean strict
a multitud case could given close alli speci unite extrem difficulty hand distinct speci unit utmost facility
in famili may genus dianthus mani speci readili crossed anoth genus silene persev effort fail produc extrem close speci singl hybrid
even within limit genus meet difference instance mani speci nicotiana larg cross speci almost genus gartner found n acuminata
veri mani analog fact could given
no one abl point kind amount differ recognis charact suffici prevent two speci crossing
it shown plant wide differ habit general appearance strong mark differ everi part flower even pollen fruit cotyledons crossed

by reciproc cross two species i mean case instance stallionhors first cross femaleass maleass mare two speci may said reciproc crossed
there often widest possibl differ facil make reciproc crosses
such case high important prove capac two speci cross often complet independ systemat affinity recognis differ whole organisation
on hand case clear show capac cross connect constitut differ impercept us confin reproduct system
this differ result reciproc cross two speci long ago observ kolreuter
to give instance mirabili jalappa easili fertilis pollen m longiflora hybrid thus produc suffici fertile kolreut tri two hundr times eight follow years fertilis reciproc
sever equal strike case could given
thuret observ fact certain seawe fuci
gartner moreover found differ facil make reciproc cross extrem common lesser degree
he observ even form close relat as matthiola annua glabra mani botanist rank varieties
it also remark fact hybrid rais reciproc crosses though cours compound two species one speci first use father mother general differ fertil small
sever singular rule could given gartner instance speci remark power cross species speci genus remark power impress like hybrid offspring
there certain hybrid instead having usual intermedi charact two parents alway close resembl one them hybrids though extern like one pure parentspecies rare except
so amongst hybrid usual intermedi structur parents except abnorm individu sometim born close resembl one pure parents hybrid almost alway utter sterile even
these fact show complet fertil hybrid independ extern resembl either pure parent
consid sever rule given govern fertil first cross hybrids see forms must consid good distinct species united fertil graduat zero perfect fertility
that fertility besid emin suscept favour unfavour conditions innat variable
that mean alway degre first cross hybrid produc cross
that fertil hybrid relat degre resembl extern appear either parent
and lastly facil make first cross two speci alway govern systemat affin degre resembl other
this latter statement clear prove reciproc cross two species accord one speci use father mother general difference occasion widest possibl
the hybrids moreover produc reciproc cross often differ fertility
now complex singular rule indic speci endow steril simpli prevent becom confound nature
i think not
for steril extrem differ degree various speci crossed must suppos would equal import keep blend together
whi degre steril innat variabl individu species
whi speci cross facility yet produc steril hybrids speci cross extrem difficulty yet produc fair fertil hybrids
whi often great differ result reciproc cross two species
why may even asked product hybrid permitted
grant speci special power produc hybrids stop propag differ degre sterility strict relat facil first union parents seem strang arrangement
the forego rule facts hand appear clear indic steril first cross hybrid simpli incident depend unknown differences chiefli reproduct systems speci
the differ peculiar limit nature that reciproc cross two speci male sexual element one often freeli act femal sexual element other revers direction
it advis explain littl fulli exampl i mean steril incident differences special endow quality
as capac one plant graft bud anoth entir unimport welfar state nature i presum one suppos capac special endow quality admit incident
we sometim see reason one tree take another differ rate growth hard wood period flow natur sap etc
 multitud case assign reason whatever
great divers size two plants one woodi herbaceous one evergreen deciduous adapt wide differ climates alway prevent two graft together
as hybridisation grafting capac limit systemat affinity one abl graft tree togeth belong quit distinct families and hand close alli species varieti species
but capacity hybridisation mean absolut govern systemat affinity
although mani distinct genera within famili graft together case speci genus take other
the pear graft far readili quince rank distinct genus apple member genus
even differ varieti pear take differ degre facil quince differ varieti apricot peach certain varieti plum
as gartner found sometim innat differ differ individu two speci crossing sagaret believ case differ individu two speci graft together
as reciproc crosses facil effect union often far equal sometim grafting common gooseberry instance cannot graft currant wherea currant take though difficulty
we seen steril hybrids reproduct organ imperfect condition differ case difficulti unit two pure species reproduct organ perfect yet two distinct case
someth analog occur grafting thouin found three speci robinia seed freeli roots could graft great difficulti anoth species thus graft render barren
on hand certain speci sorbus graft species yield twice much fruit roots
we remind latter fact extraordinari case hippeastrum lobelia etc
 seed much freeli fertilis pollen distinct species selffertilis pollen
we thus see although clear fundament differ mere adhes graft stocks union male femal element act reproduction yet rude degre parallel result
and must look curious complex law govern facil tree graft incident unknown differ veget systems i believ still complex law govern facil
these differences cases follow certain extent might expected systemat affinity everi kind resembl dissimilar organ be attempt expressed
the fact mean seem indic greater lesser difficulti either graft cross togeth various speci special endowment although case crossing difficulti import endur
caus of the steril of first cross and of hybrids
we may look littl closer probabl caus steril first cross hybrids
these two case fundament different for remarked union two pure speci male femal sexual element perfect wherea hybrid imperfect
even first crosses greater lesser difficulti effect union appar depend sever distinct causes
there must sometim physic imposs male element reach ovule would case plant pistil long pollentub reach ovarium
it also observ pollen one speci place stigma distant alli species though pollentub protrude penetr stigmat surface
again male element may reach femal element incap caus embryo developed seem case thuret experi fuci
no explan given facts certain tree cannot graft others
lastly embryo may developed perish earli period
this latter altern suffici attend to i believe observ communic mr hewitt great experi hybridis gallinac birds earli death embryo frequent caus
i first unwil believ view hybrids born general healthi longlived see case common mule
hybrids however differ circumstanc birth born live countri two parent live general place suitabl condit life
but hybrid partak half natur constitut mother therefor birth long nourish within mother womb within egg seed produc mother may expos condit
in regard steril hybrids sexual element imperfect developed case different
i allud larg bodi facts i collected show anim plant remov natur conditions extrem liabl reproduct system serious affected
this fact great bar domest animals
between steril thus superinduc hybrids mani point similarity
in case steril independ general health often accompani excess size great luxuriance
in cases steril occur various degrees both male element liabl affected sometim femal male
in both tendenc goe certain extent systemat affinity whole group anim plant render impot unnatur conditions whole group speci tend produc steril hybrids
on hand one speci group sometim resist great chang condit unimpair fertility certain speci group produc unusu fertil hybrids
no one tell till tries whether particular anim breed confin plant seed freeli culture tell till tries whether two speci genus produc less steril hybrids
lastly organ be place sever generat condit natur them extrem liabl vary due i believe reproduct system special affected though lesser degre
so hybrids hybrid success generat emin liabl vary everi experimentalist observed
thus see organ be place new unnatur conditions hybrid produc unnatur cross two species reproduct system independ general state health affect steril
in one case condit life disturbed though often slight degre inappreci us case hybrids extern condit remain same organis disturb
for scarc possibl two organis compound one without disturb occur development period action mutual relat differ part organ one another condit
when hybrid abl breed inter se transmit offspr generat generat compound organisation henc need surpris sterility though degre variable rare diminishes
it must however confess cannot understand except vagu hypotheses sever fact respect steril hybrids instance unequ fertil hybrid produc reciproc crosses increas steril
nor i pretend forego remark go root matter explan offer organism place unnatur conditions render sterile
all i attempt show two cases respect allied steril common resultin one case condit life disturbed case organis disturb two

the explan lies i believe extrem imperfect geolog record
in first place alway born mind sort intermedi form must theory former existed

so natur species look form distinct instanc hors tapir reason suppos link ever exist direct intermedi them unknown common parent

a littl reflect explain along rise coast western side south america extens format recent tertiari remain anywher found though suppli sediment must age great enorm
the explanation doubt is littor sublittor deposit continu worn away soon brought slow gradual rise land within grind action coastwaves
we may i think safe conclud sediment must accumul extrem thick solid extens masses order withstand incess action waves first uprais subsequ oscil level
such thick extens accumul sediment may form two ways either profound depth sea case judg research e forbes may conclud bottom inhabit extrem animals
in latter case long rate subsid suppli sediment near balanc other sea remain shallow favour life thus fossilifer format thick enough upraised resist amount
i convinc ancient formations rich fossils thus form subsidence
sinc publish view subject  i watch progress geology surpris note author author treat great formation come conclus accumul

for welfar young animal long remain mother womb egg long nourish protect parent must quit unimport whether charact fulli acquir littl earlier
it would signify instance bird obtain food best long beak whether assum beak particular length long fed parents
hence i conclude quit possible mani success modifications speci acquir present structure may superven earli period life direct evid domest

i far mean invari case i could give good mani case variat take word largest sense superven earlier age child parent
these two principles truth admitted will i believe explain specifi lead fact embryology
