 roxana illustration i rich beautiful agreeable yet old page  the crippleg edit the work of daniel defo the fortun mistress or a histori of the life of mademoisell de beleau known by the name of the ladi roxana new
 the amour draw to an end  roxana daughter and the quaker  roxana is confront with her daughter  introduct in march  publish narrat defo came perhap even nearer moll flanders write
be person known name ladi roxana time king charl ii
no second edit appear till defo death occur 
then years various edit the fortun mistress came out
becaus defo indic end chief charact clear usual stories sever later edit carri histori heroine
probabl none continu defo himself though one edit  attribut him
for reason literari merit includ present edition
that continu defo attest various ways
in first place tell histori roxana death july  date defo would like fix die april 
moreover statement sixtyfour died agre statement begin defo narrat ten year old 
she must born  consequ would sixtynin 
this discrepancy however ceas import consid general confus date part book certain defoe
the titlepag announc heroin known name ladi roxana time king charl ii
she must known name child eleven twelve then ten parent fled england about  charl ii
die february 
moreover marri till fifteen live eight year husband mistress success friend jeweller prince dutch merchant
yet career return london time becom note toast among charl ii
s courtier entertain hous monarch duke monmouth
a stronger argument differ authorship differ style continu roxana earlier narrative
in continu defo bestknown manner lacking two instanc show
critic often call attent fact fright instead frighten favourit word defoe
now frighten fright verb use continuation
furthermore i point previous introduction defo fond make charact smile show either kindli shrewd penetration
they smile continuation
there differ origin stori the fortun mistress continu 
the former better narrat latter move quicker real
and yet manifest attempt continu imit manner substanc stori proper
there dialogue example roxana quakeress model dialogu defo fond of
again fair success attempt copi defo circumstantiality amount detail continu make graphic much fiction given world
and finally understand reproduc charact roxana amy anonym author done remark well
the charact roxana daughter less true defo conception girl drew her actuat natur affect seek mother less interest
the charact dutch merchant likewise chang better continuation
he develop vindict which former meet him seem foreign nature
i said the fortun mistress defo come nearer usual write today call novel reason success usual make charact real
though mani still woodenlifeless types rather individualsyet prince quakeress dutch merchant occasion wake life rather unfortun daughter yet ami roxana
with except moll flanders last two vitalis personag defo invented
in pair furthermore defo seem interest bring contrast characters
the servant amy thrown anoth mistress might total differ woman
the vulgar servant would retain circumstances even promot maid companion roxana unreason devot mistress combin weak character led
roxana part full independence initiative woman withoutor rather without act herself act interest mistress ami differ creature
like defo princip characters roxana emin practical coldblood selfish
after first pang part five children seldom think except encumbrances provid decent without person inconvenience even slight sacrific sake one much
toward men dealings toward friend quakeress minories too show calcul retic unfeminine
the continu stori endow heroin wholli characterist selfish made her hear ami death feel less sorrow miser fate friend loss adviser
and yet roxana capabl fine feeling prove tear joy happi chang fortunes bring realist love scene princ regard suppos paint cheeks
again shipwreck threaten amy emot repent due much thought degrad ami level thought flagrant sins
that capabl feel gratitude show generos quakeress
and rage remorse suspect daughter murdered emot sever time see children roxana show true woman
in short though part monument selfish yet save imposs sever display nobl emotion
one surprises student defoe thickskinned mercantil writer vulgarest great men letter earli eighteenth century seem known woman heart better mans
at least succeed make two three women charact aliv men
it anoth surpris write women defo often seem ahead age
in argument roxana dutch merchant woman independence roxana talk like charact problem play novel day
this perhaps defo credit credit said elsewhere a woman wellbr welltaught furnish 
accomplish knowledg behaviour creatur without comparison societi emblem sublim enjoyments 
man one portion noth rejoic her thankful
after read words one cannot regret defo tri creat heroin virtuous moll flander roxana
it draw charact defoe the fortun mistress come nearer usual produc novel
this narrat less loos construct other except robinson crusoe journal plagu year easier give structur to

this i wish for i took up serv serv notori thiev englandhang chains terror others
it imposs imagin effect had fowl would come corn but short forsook part island i could never see bird near place long scarecrow
this i glad of may sure latter end december second harvest year i reap corn
i sad put scyth sickl cut down i could make one well i could one broadswords cutlasses i save among arm ship
however first crop small i great difficulti cut down short i reap way i cut noth ears carri away great basket i made rub hands
however great encourag me i foresaw that time would pleas god suppli bread
and yet i perplex again i neither knew grind make meal corn inde clean part it nor made meal make bread it make it yet i knew bake it
these thing ad desir good quantiti store secur constant supply i resolv tast crop preserv seed next season meantim employ studi
it might truli said i work bread
i believ peopl thought much upon strang multitud littl thing necessari providing producing curing dressing making finish one articl bread
i reduc mere state nature found daili discouragement made sensibl everi hour even i got first hand seedcorn which i said came unexpectedly inde surprise
first i plough turn earthno spade shovel dig it
well i conquer make wooden spade i observ before work wooden manner though cost great mani day make it yet want iron wore soon made work harder
however i bore with content work patience bear bad performance
when corn sown i harrow forc go myself drag great heavi bough tree it scratch it may called rather rake harrow it
when growing grown i observ alreadi mani thing i want fenc it secur it mow reap it cure carri home thrash part chaff save it
then i want mill grind it siev dress it yeast salt make bread oven bake it thing i without shall observed yet corn inestim comfort advantag too
all this i said made everyth labori tedious me help for
neither time much loss me because i divid it certain part everi day appoint works i resolv use none corn bread till i greater quantiti me i next six month
chapter ixa boat but first i prepar land i seed enough sow acr ground
befor i this i week work least make spade which done sorri one indeed heavy requir doubl labour work it
however i got that sow seed two larg flat piec ground near hous i could find mind fenc good hedge stake cut wood i set before knew
this work take less three months great part time wet season i could go abroad
withindoors rain i could go out i found employ follow occupationsalway observing i work i divert talk parrot teach speak i quick taught
this therefore work assist work now i said i great employ upon hands follows i long studi make mean other earthen vessels which indeed i want sorely knew
however consid heat climate i doubt i could find clay i might make pot might dri sun hard enough strong enough bear handling hold anyth dry requir
 thing i doing i resolv make larg i could fit stand like jars hold put them
it would make reader piti me rather laugh me tell mani awkward way i took rais paste odd misshapen ugli thing i made mani fell mani fell out clay stiff enough bear
however sun bake two dri hard i lift gentl up set two great wicker baskets i made purpos them might break pot basket
though i miscarri much design larg pots yet i made sever smaller thing better success littl round pots flat dishes pitchers pipkins thing hand turn to heat sun bake quit hard
but would answer end get earthen pot hold liquid bear fire none could do
it happen time make pretti larg fire cook meat i went put i done it i found broken piec one earthenwar vessel fire burnt hard stone red tile
i agreeabl surpris see it said myself certain might made burn whole would burn broken
this set studi order fire make burn pots
i notion kiln potter burn in glaze lead though i lead with i place three larg pipkin two three pot pile one upon another place firewood round it
i pli fire fresh fuel round outsid upon top till i saw pot insid redhot quit through observ crack all
when i saw clear red i let stand heat five six hours till i found one them though crack melt run sand mix clay melt violenc heat would run
after experiment i need say i want sort earthenwar use i must need say shape them indifferent one may suppose i way make children make dirt pies
no joy thing mean natur ever equal mine i found i made earthen pot would bear fire i hard patienc stay till cold i set one fire water boil
my next concern get stone mortar stamp beat corn in mill thought arriv perfect art one pair hands
to suppli want i great loss for trade world i perfect unqualifi stonecutt whatever neither i tool go with
i spent mani day find great stone big enough cut hollow make fit mortar could find none all except solid rock i way dig cut out inde rock island hard
so great deal time lost search stone i gave over resolv look great block hard wood i found indeed much easier get one big i strength stir i round it form
after this i made great heavi pestl beater wood call ironwood i prepar laid i next crop corn i propos grind rather pound meal make bread
my next difficulti make siev searce dress meal part bran husk without i see possibl i could bread
this difficult thing even think on sure i noth like necessari thing make iti mean fine thin canva stuff searc meal through

thus two year time i thick grove five six year time i wood dwelling grow monstrous thick strong inde perfect impassable men kind soever could ever imagin
as way i propos go for i left avenue set two ladders one part rock low broke in left room place anoth ladder upon that two ladder
thus i took measur human prudenc could suggest preservation seen length altogeth without reason though i foresaw noth time mere fear suggest me

at last one gunner made stinkpot call it composit smokes flame burn withal smoke thick smell intoler nauseous suffered
this threw tree himself wait effect it heard saw noth night next day conclud men within smothered when sudden next night heard upon top tree
