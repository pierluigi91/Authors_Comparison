the thing is much buy wages
that idea
while true good mechan allow three dollar half year us dollar seventyfive thereyer confess again yer confess again
confound it iv never deni it i tell you
what i say this
with us half dollar buy dollar buy youand therefor stand reason commonest kind commonsense wage higher yours
he look dazed said despairingly verily i cannot make out
yev said higher breath ye take back
oh great scott isnt possibl get simpl thing head
now look herelet illustrate
we pay four cent woman stuff gown pay 
 four mill double
what allow labor woman work farm
two mill day
veri good allow half much pay tenth cent day and again yer conf wait
now see thing simple time youll understand it
for instance take woman  day earn gown  mill day week work earn forti daystwo day short  weeks
your woman gown whole seven week wage gone gown two day wage left buy someth els with
therenow understand it
he lookedwell mere look dubious it i say others
i waitedto let thing work
dowley spoke lastand betray fact actual hadnt gotten away root ground superstit yet
he said trifl hesitancy butbuty cannot fail grant two mill day better one
shucks
well course i hate give up
so i chanc anoth flyer let us suppos case
suppos one journeymen goe buy follow articles  pound salt  dozen eggs  dozen pint beer  bushel wheat  towlinen suit  pound beef  pound mutton
the lot cost  cents
it take  work day earn money week  days
let come us work  day half wages buy thing shade   cents cost shade  day work half week wage over
carri year would save near week wage everi two months your man nothing thus save five six week wage year man cent

and leav town whenev want to wage dont suit him
and cant put pillori it
perdit catch age
shout dowley strong indignation
an age dogs age barren rever superior respect authority
the pillory oh wait brother say good word institution
i think pillori ought abolished
a strang idea
why
well ill tell why
is man ever put pillori capit crime
no
is right condemn man slight punish small offens kill him
there answer
i score first point
for first time smith wasnt ready
the compani notic it
good effect
you dont answer brother
you glorifi pillori ago shed piti futur age isnt go use it
i think pillori ought abolished
what usual happen poor fellow put pillori littl offens didnt amount anyth world
the mob tri fun him dont they
yes
they begin clod him laugh piec see tri dodg one clod get hit another
yes
then throw dead cat him dont they
yes
well then suppos person enemi mob man woman secret grudg himand suppos especi unpopular community pride prosperity one thing
there doubt it

you wouldnt think much risk take chanc stocks
dowley winced visibly
i judg hit
but didnt betray spoken word
as others spoke plainly strong feeling
they said seen enough stock know man chanc was would never consent enter could compromis quick death hanging
well chang subjectfor i think iv establish point stock ought abolished
i think law pretti unfair
for instance i thing ought deliv stocks know i yet keep still dont report me you get stock anybodi inform you
ah would serv right said dowley for must inform
so saith law
the other coincided
well right let go sinc vote down
but there one thing certain isnt fair
the magistr fix mechan wage one cent day instance
the law say master shall venture even utmost press business pay anyth over cent day even singl day shall fine pillori it whoever know doesnt inform also shall
now seem unfair dowley dead peril us thoughtless confessed ago within week paid cent fifteen mil oh i tell you smasher
