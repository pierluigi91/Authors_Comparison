no second edit appear till defo death occur 
then years various edit the fortun mistress came out
becaus defo indic end chief charact clear usual stories sever later edit carri histori heroine
probabl none continu defo himself though one edit  attribut him
for reason literari merit includ present edition
that continu defo attest various ways
in first place tell histori roxana death july  date defo would like fix die april

a stronger argument differ authorship differ style continu roxana earlier narrative
in continu defo bestknown manner lacking two instanc show
critic often call attent fact fright instead frighten favourit word defoe

and finally understand reproduc charact roxana amy anonym author done remark well
the charact roxana daughter less true defo conception girl drew her actuat natur affect seek mother less interest
the charact dutch merchant likewise chang better continuation
he develop vindict which former meet him seem foreign nature
i said the fortun mistress defo come nearer usual write today call novel reason success usual make charact real
