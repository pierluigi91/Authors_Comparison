this voyage however held us eleven day all length spent provisions everi drop water had spi land great joy though distanc ten eleven leagues as land wind came
this gave us tast done ventur forward scant wind uncertain weather gave us surfeit design main least might better vessel us went shore again

we continu voyag south mani weeks though sever interv go shore get provis water
at length come round point land lay leagu ordinari sea agreeabl surpris sight which doubt disagre concerned pleasant us
this wreck european ship cast away upon rocks place run great way sea
we could see plainly low water great deal ship lay dry even high water entir covered lie leagu shore
it easili believ curios led us wind weather also permitting go direct her without difficulty present found dutchbuilt ship could long

the voyage undertaken great deal ignor desperation realli carri much resolut judgment knew cours steer this anywher west within two
however pleas god wind continu fair se e found nw w right afor it good cours us could go thus went on
the voyag much longer expected vessel also sail proport her made littl way sea sail heavily
we had indeed great adventur happen voyage way everyth could offer divert us see vessel least occas hail anyth voyage saw one vessel small
we eight nine day sail fair wind when great joy one men cri land
we great reason glad discovery water enough left two three day more though short allowance
however though earli morn discov it made near night reach it wind slacken almost calm ship being i said dull sailer
we sad baulk upon come land found that instead mainland africa littl island inhabit upon it least none could find cattle except goats kill
however serv us fresh meat found good water fifteen day reach main which however last arriv at essenti us came provis

secondly adventur sail along coast mozambique desol shore africa north till came red sea could hope taken arabs sold slave turks
we could build anyth vessel would carri us great arabian sea india could reach cape de bona speranza wind variable sea latitud tempestuous knew could cross
i cannot say consult i ever began enter weight merit enterpris went upon till now
my view was i thought good viz
 get arabian gulf mouth red sea wait vessel pass repass there plenty seiz upon first came force enrich cargo
but positive i might well held tongue i submitted told i would keep first law govern majority resolv upon journey
the first thing take observation see whereabout world were did found latitud  degre  minut south line
the next thing look charts see coast countri aim at found   degre south latitude went coast angola   degre north latitude made river niger
our aim coast angola which chart had lie near latitud in cours thither due west assur meet rivers doubt help might eas
the next thing consid was carri baggage first determin travel without neither inde possibl us so even ammunition absolut necessari us
we inquir country found beast burthen known among them say neither hors mules asses camels dromedaries creatur kind buffalo tame bull one killed
but understood noth manag guid creature bind burthen upon them last part consult puzzl us extremely
at last i propos method them which consideration found convenient was quarrel negro natives take ten twelv prisoners bind slaves caus travel us
this counsel accept first nativ soon gave reason approv it also gave opportun put practice for littl traffic nativ hitherto upon faith first kindness found
