i swam round twice second time i spi small piec rope i wonder i see first hung forechain low great difficulti i got hold it help rope i got
here i found ship bulged great deal water hold lay side bank hard sand or rather earth stern lay lift upon bank head low almost water
by mean quarter free part dry may sure first work search see spoil free
and first i found ship provis dri untouch water well dispos eat i went bread room fill pocket biscuit ate i went things i time lose
i also found rum great cabin i took larg dram i had indeed need enough spirit me
now i want noth boat furnish mani thing i foresaw would necessari me

when done i went ship side pull me i tie four togeth end well i could form raft lay two three short piec plank upon crossways i found i could walk upon
so i went work carpent saw i cut spare topmast three lengths ad raft great deal labour pains
but hope furnish necessari encourag go beyond i abl done upon anoth occasion
my raft strong enough bear reason weight
my next care load with preserv i laid upon surf sea i long consid this

bread rice three dutch cheeses five piec dri goat flesh which live much upon littl remaind european corn laid fowl brought sea us fowl killed
there barley wheat together but great disappointment i found afterward rat eaten spoil all
as liquors i found several case bottl belong skipper cordial waters and all five six gallon rack

while i this i found tide begin flow though calm i mortif see coat shirt waistcoat i left shore upon sand swim away
as breeches linen openkneed i swam board stockings
however set rummag clothes i found enough took i want present use i other thing eye uponas first tool work shore
and long search i found carpent chest was indeed use prize me much valuabl shipload gold would time

those two i got raft arms
and i thought pretti well freighted began think i get shore them neither sail oar rudder least cap wind would overset navigation
i three encouragementsst smooth calm sea ndly tide rising set shore rdly littl wind blew toward land
and thus found two three broken oar belong boatand besid tool chest i found two saws axe hammer cargo i put sea
for mile thereabout raft went well i found drive littl distant place i land before i perceiv indraft water consequ i hope find creek river
as i imagined was
there appear littl open land i found strong current tide set it i guid raft well i could keep middl stream
but i like suffer second shipwreck which i had i think verili would broken heart for know noth coast raft ran aground one end upon shoal aground end want
i utmost set back chests keep places could thrust raft strength neither durst i stir postur i in hold chest might i stood
i look side proper place get shore i will driven high river hope time see ship sea therefor resolv place near coast i could
at length i spi littl cove right shore creek great pain difficulti i guid raft last got near that reach ground oar i could thrust direct in
but i like dip cargo sea again shore lie pretti steepthat say slopingther place land one end float ran shore would lie high sink lower
all i could wait till tide highest keep raft oar like anchor hold side fast shore near flat piec ground i expect water would flow over did
as soon i found water enoughfor raft drew foot wateri thrust upon flat piec ground fasten moor her stick two broken oar ground one one side near one end one
my next work view country seek proper place habitation stow good secur whatev might happen
where i was i yet knew not whether contin island whether inhabit inhabited whether danger wild beast not
there hill mile me rose steep high seem overtop hills lay ridg northward
i took one fowlingpieces one pistols horn powder thus armed i travel discoveri top hill where i great labour difficulti got top i saw fate great
i island environ everi way sea land seen except rocks lay great way off two small islands less this lay three leagu west
i found also island i barren and i saw good reason believe uninhabit except wild beasts whom however i saw none
yet i saw abund fowls knew kinds neither i kill could i tell fit food not
at come back i shot great bird i saw sit upon tree side great wood
i believ first gun fire sinc creation world
i sooner fired part wood aros innumer number fowls mani sorts make confus scream crying everi one accord usual note one kind i knew
as creatur i killed i took kind hawk colour beak resembl it talon claw common
it flesh carrion fit nothing
content discovery i came back raft fell work bring cargo shore took rest day
what night i knew not inde rest i afraid lie ground know wild beast might devour me though i afterward found realli need fears
however well i could i barricad round chest board i brought shore made kind hut night lodging
as food i yet saw way suppli myself except i seen two three creatur like hare run wood i shot fowl
i began consid i might yet get great mani thing ship would use me particular rig sails thing might come land i resolv make anoth voyag board
and i knew first storm blew must necessarili break pieces i resolv set thing apart till i got everyth ship i could get
then i call councilthat say thoughtswheth i take back raft appear impracticable i resolv go before tide down i so i strip i went hut
i got board ship before prepar second raft and experi first i neither made unwieldy load hard yet i brought away sever thing use me first carpent store i
all i secured togeth sever thing belong gunner particular two three iron crows two barrel musket bullets seven muskets anoth fowlingpiece small quantiti powder more larg bag small shot
besid things i took men cloth i could find spare foretopsail hammock bedding i load second raft brought safe shore great comfort
i apprehension absenc land least provis might devour shore i came back i found sign visitor sat creatur like wild cat upon one chests which i
she sat compos unconcerned look full face mind acquaint me
i present gun her but understand it perfect unconcern it offer stir away upon i toss bit biscuit though way i free it store great however
have got second cargo shorethough i fain open barrel powder bring parcels heavy larg casksi went work make littl tent sail pole i cut
when i done this i block door tent board within empti chest set end without spread one bed upon ground lay two pistol head gun length me i went bed
i biggest magazin kind ever laid up i believe one man i satisfi still ship sat upright posture i thought i ought get everyth i could everi day low water
in word i brought away sails first last i fain cut pieces bring much time i could use sails mere canva only
but comfort still was last all i made five six voyag these thought i noth expect ship worth meddl withi say this i found great hogshead
i soon empti hogshead bread wrap up parcel parcel piec sails i cut out and word i got safe shore also
the next day i made anoth voyage now plunder ship portabl fit hand out i began cables
cut great cabl pieces i could move i got two cabl hawser shore ironwork i could get cut spritsailyard mizzenyard everyth i could make larg raft i load
but good luck began leav me raft unwieldy overladen that i enter littl cove i land rest goods abl guid handili i other overset threw
as myself great harm i near shore cargo great part lost especi iron i expect would great use me however tide out i got piec
after this i went everi day board brought away i could get
i thirteen day shore eleven time board ship time i brought away one pair hand could well suppos capabl bring though i believ verily calm weather held i
but prepar twelfth time go board i found wind began rise however low water i went board though i thought i rummag cabin effectu noth could found yet i discov locker drawer
i smile sight money o drug
 said i aloud what art thou good for
thou art worth meno take ground one knive worth heap i manner use theeeen remain thou art go bottom creatur whose life worth saying
however upon second thought i took away wrap piec canvas i began think make anoth raft i prepar this i found sky overcast wind began rise quarter hour blew
it present occur vain pretend make raft wind offshore busi gone tide flood began otherwis i might abl reach shore all
accordingly i let water swam across channel lay ship sands even difficulti enough part weight thing i me part rough water
but i got home littl tent i lay wealth me secure
it blew hard night morning i look out behold ship seen
i littl surprised recov satisfactori reflect i lost time abat diligence get everyth could use me that indeed littl left i abl
i gave thought ship anyth her except might drive shore wreck as indeed diver piec afterward did thing small use me
my thought wholli employ secur either savages appear wild beasts island i mani thought method this kind dwell makewheth i
i soon found place i fit settlement upon low moorish ground near sea i believ would wholesome particular fresh water near it i resolv find
i consult sever thing situation i found would proper me st health fresh water i mentioned ndly shelter heat sun rdly secur raven creatures whether man beast thly view
in search place proper this i found littl plain side rise hill whose front toward littl plain steep houseside noth could come upon top
on one side rock hollow place worn littl way in like entranc door cave realli cave way rock all
on flat green hollow place i resolv pitch tent
this plain hundr yard broad twice long lay like green door and end it descend irregular everi way low ground seaside

befor i set tent i drew halfcircl hollow place took ten yard semidiamet rock twenti yard diamet begin ending
in halfcircl i pitch two row strong stakes drive ground till stood firm like piles biggest end ground five feet half sharpen top
the two row stand six inch one another
then i took piec cabl i cut ship laid rows one upon another within circle two row stakes top place stake inside lean them two feet half
this cost great deal time labour especi cut pile woods bring place drive earth
the entranc place i made be door short ladder go top ladder i in i lift me i complet fenc fortified i thought world consequ

before i walk about either hunt view country anguish soul condit would break upon sudden heart would die within me think woods mountains desert i in
in midst greatest composur mind would break upon like storm make wring hand weep like child
sometim would take middl work i would immedi sit sigh look upon ground hour two together still wors me i could burst tears vent words would go
but i began exercis new thoughts i daili read word god appli comfort present state
one morning sad i open bibl upon words i never never leav thee forsak thee

 so i stop there though i could say i thank god there yet i sincer gave thank god open eyes whatev afflict providences see former condit life mourn wickedness
i never open bible shut it soul within bless god direct friend england without order mine pack among goods assist afterward save wreck ship
thus disposit mind i began third year though i given reader troubl particular account work year first yet general may observ i seldom idle
also considered middl day sun zenith violenc heat great stir out four hour even time i could suppos work in exception
to short time allow labour i desir may ad exceed labori work mani hour which want tools want help want skill everyth i took time
for example i full two forti day make board long shelf i want cave whereas two sawyers tool sawpit would cut six tree half day
my case this larg tree cut down board broad one
this tree i three day cut down two cut boughs reduc log piec timber
with inexpress hack hew i reduc side chip till began light enough move i turn it made one side smooth flat board end end then turn side downward cut
ani one may judg labour hand piec work labour patienc carri that mani things
i observ particular show reason much time went away littl workviz
might littl done help tools vast labour requir prodigi time alone hand
but notwithstand this patienc labour i got everyth circumst made necessari do appear follows
i now month novemb december expect crop barley rice
the ground i manur dug great for i observed seed quantiti half peck i lost one whole crop sow dri season
but crop promis well sudden i found i danger lose enemi sever sorts scarc possibl keep it as first goats wild creatur i call hares who tast
this i saw remedi make enclosur hedge i great deal toil more requir speed
however arabl land small suit crop i got total well fenc three week time shoot creatur daytime i set dog guard night tie stake gate
but beast ruin before corn blade bird like ruin now ear for go along place see throve i saw littl crop surround fowls i know mani
i immedi let fli among them i alway gun me
i sooner shot rose littl cloud fowls i seen all among corn itself
this touch sensibly i foresaw day would devour hopes i starved never abl rais crop all i could tell however i resolv lose corn possible though i
in first place i went among see damag alreadi done found spoil good deal it yet green them loss great remaind like good crop could
i stay load gun come away i could easili see thiev sit upon tree me wait till i gone away event prove so i walk off i gone i sooner
i provoked i could patienc stay till came on know everi grain ate was might said peckloaf consequence come hedge i fire again kill three them
this i wish for i took up serv serv notori thiev englandhang chains terror others
it imposs imagin effect had fowl would come corn but short forsook part island i could never see bird near place long scarecrow
this i glad of may sure latter end december second harvest year i reap corn
i sad put scyth sickl cut down i could make one well i could one broadswords cutlasses i save among arm ship
however first crop small i great difficulti cut down short i reap way i cut noth ears carri away great basket i made rub hands
however great encourag me i foresaw that time would pleas god suppli bread
and yet i perplex again i neither knew grind make meal corn inde clean part it nor made meal make bread it make it yet i knew bake it
these thing ad desir good quantiti store secur constant supply i resolv tast crop preserv seed next season meantim employ studi
it might truli said i work bread
i believ peopl thought much upon strang multitud littl thing necessari providing producing curing dressing making finish one articl bread
i reduc mere state nature found daili discouragement made sensibl everi hour even i got first hand seedcorn which i said came unexpectedly inde surprise
first i plough turn earthno spade shovel dig it
well i conquer make wooden spade i observ before work wooden manner though cost great mani day make it yet want iron wore soon made work harder
however i bore with content work patience bear bad performance
when corn sown i harrow forc go myself drag great heavi bough tree it scratch it may called rather rake harrow it
when growing grown i observ alreadi mani thing i want fenc it secur it mow reap it cure carri home thrash part chaff save it
then i want mill grind it siev dress it yeast salt make bread oven bake it thing i without shall observed yet corn inestim comfort advantag too
all this i said made everyth labori tedious me help for
neither time much loss me because i divid it certain part everi day appoint works i resolv use none corn bread till i greater quantiti me i next six month
chapter ixa boat but first i prepar land i seed enough sow acr ground
befor i this i week work least make spade which done sorri one indeed heavy requir doubl labour work it
however i got that sow seed two larg flat piec ground near hous i could find mind fenc good hedge stake cut wood i set before knew
this work take less three months great part time wet season i could go abroad
withindoors rain i could go out i found employ follow occupationsalway observing i work i divert talk parrot teach speak i quick taught
this therefore work assist work now i said i great employ upon hands follows i long studi make mean other earthen vessels which indeed i want sorely knew
however consid heat climate i doubt i could find clay i might make pot might dri sun hard enough strong enough bear handling hold anyth dry requir
 thing i doing i resolv make larg i could fit stand like jars hold put them
it would make reader piti me rather laugh me tell mani awkward way i took rais paste odd misshapen ugli thing i made mani fell mani fell out clay stiff enough bear
however sun bake two dri hard i lift gentl up set two great wicker baskets i made purpos them might break pot basket
though i miscarri much design larg pots yet i made sever smaller thing better success littl round pots flat dishes pitchers pipkins thing hand turn to heat sun bake quit hard
but would answer end get earthen pot hold liquid bear fire none could do
it happen time make pretti larg fire cook meat i went put i done it i found broken piec one earthenwar vessel fire burnt hard stone red tile
i agreeabl surpris see it said myself certain might made burn whole would burn broken
this set studi order fire make burn pots
i notion kiln potter burn in glaze lead though i lead with i place three larg pipkin two three pot pile one upon another place firewood round it
i pli fire fresh fuel round outsid upon top till i saw pot insid redhot quit through observ crack all
when i saw clear red i let stand heat five six hours till i found one them though crack melt run sand mix clay melt violenc heat would run
after experiment i need say i want sort earthenwar use i must need say shape them indifferent one may suppose i way make children make dirt pies
no joy thing mean natur ever equal mine i found i made earthen pot would bear fire i hard patienc stay till cold i set one fire water boil
my next concern get stone mortar stamp beat corn in mill thought arriv perfect art one pair hands
to suppli want i great loss for trade world i perfect unqualifi stonecutt whatever neither i tool go with
i spent mani day find great stone big enough cut hollow make fit mortar could find none all except solid rock i way dig cut out inde rock island hard
so great deal time lost search stone i gave over resolv look great block hard wood i found indeed much easier get one big i strength stir i round it form
after this i made great heavi pestl beater wood call ironwood i prepar laid i next crop corn i propos grind rather pound meal make bread
my next difficulti make siev searce dress meal part bran husk without i see possibl i could bread
this difficult thing even think on sure i noth like necessari thing make iti mean fine thin canva stuff searc meal through
and i full stop mani months i realli know do
linen i none left mere rags i goat hair neither knew weav spin it i known how tool work with
all remedi i found was last i rememb i had among seamen cloth save ship neckcloth calico muslin piec i made three small siev proper enough
the bake part next thing considered i make bread i came corn first i yeast
as part suppli want i concern much it
but oven i inde great pain
at length i found experi also this i made earthenvessel broad deep say two feet diameter nine inch deep
these i burn fire i done other laid by i want bake i made great fire upon hearth i pave squar tile bake burn also i call square
when firewood burn pretti much ember live coals i drew forward upon hearth cover over i let lie till hearth hot
then sweep away embers i set loaf loaves whelm earthen pot upon them drew ember round outsid pot keep add heat thus well best oven world i bake
it need wonder thing took part third year abod here observ interv thing i new harvest husbandri manage i reap corn season
and now indeed stock corn increasing i realli want build barn bigger i want place lay in increas corn yield much i barley twenti bushels rice much more
upon whole i found forti bushel barley rice much i could consum year i resolv sow quantiti everi year i sow last hope quantiti would fulli provid bread
all thing doing may sure thought ran mani time upon prospect land i seen side island i without secret wish i shore there fanci that see
but i made allow danger undertaking i might fall hand savages perhap i might reason think far wors lion tiger africa i came
then suppos cannibals yet might kill me mani european fallen hand served even ten twenti togethermuch i one could make littl defence
now i wish boy xury longboat shoulderofmutton sail i sail thousand mile coast africa vain i thought i would go look ship boat which i said blown
she lay almost first quite turned forc wave winds almost bottom upward high ridg beachy rough sand water her
if i hand refit her launch water boat would done well enough i might gone back brazil easili enough i might foreseen i could turn set
i spare pains indeed piec fruitless toil spent i think three four week it last find imposs heav littl strength i fell dig away sand undermin it make fall
but i done this i unabl stir again get it much less move forward toward water i forc give over yet though i gave hope boat desir ventur main
this length put upon think whether possibl make canoe periagua nativ climat make even without tools or i might say without hands trunk great tree
this i thought possible easy pleas extrem thought make it much conveni negro indians consid particular inconveni i
want hand move it made watera difficulti much harder surmount consequ want tool could them me i chosen vast tree woods much
one would thought i could least reflect upon mind circumst i make boat i immedi thought i get sea thought intent upon voyag
i went work upon boat like fool ever man sens awake
