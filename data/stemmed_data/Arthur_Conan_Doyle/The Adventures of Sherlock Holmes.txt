on one whimsic littl incid happen four million human be jostl within space squar miles
amid action reaction dens swarm humanity everi possibl combin event may expect take place mani littl problem present may strike bizarr without criminal
we alreadi experi such
so much so i remarked that last six case i ad notes three entir free legal crime
precisely
you allud attempt recov iren adler papers singular case miss mari sutherland adventur man twist lip
well i doubt small matter fall innoc category
you know peterson commissionaire
yes
it trophi belongs
it hat
no no found it
it owner unknown
i beg look upon batter billycock intellectu problem
and first came here
it arriv upon christma morning compani good fat goose is i doubt roast moment front peterson fire
the fact these four oclock christma morning peterson who know honest fellow return small jollif make way homeward tottenham court road
in front saw gaslight tallish man walk slight stagger carri white goos slung shoulder
as reach corner goodg street row broke stranger littl knot roughs

what then peterson do
he brought round hat goos christma morning know even smallest problem interest me
the goos retain morning sign that spite slight frost would well eaten without unnecessari delay
it finder carri off therefore fulfil ultim destini goose i continu retain hat unknown gentleman lost christma dinner
did advertise
no
then clue could identity
on much deduce
from hat
precisely
but joking
what gather old batter felt
here lens
you know methods
what gather individu man worn article
i took tatter object hand turn rather ruefully
it ordinari black hat usual round shape hard much wors wear
the line red silk good deal discoloured
there maker name but holm remarked initi h
b scrawl upon one side
it pierc brim hatsecurer elast missing
for rest cracked exceed dusty spot sever places although seem attempt hide discolour patch smear ink
i see nothing said i hand back friend
on contrary watson see everything
you fail however reason see
you timid draw inferences
then pray tell infer hat
he pick gaze peculiar introspect fashion characterist him
it perhap less suggest might been remarked and yet infer distinct other repres least strong balanc probability
that man high intellectu cours obvious upon face it also fair welltodo within last three years although fallen upon evil days
he foresight less formerly point moral retrogression which taken declin fortunes seem indic evil influence probabl drink work upon him
this may account also obvious fact wife ceas love him
mi dear holmes
he has however retain degre selfrespect continued disregard remonstrance
he man lead sedentari life goe little train entirely middleaged grizzl hair cut within last days anoint limecream
these patent fact deduc hat
also way extrem improb gas laid house
you certain joking holmes
not least
is possibl even now i give results unabl see attained
i doubt i stupid i must confess i unabl follow you
for example deduc man intellectual
for answer holm clap hat upon head
it came right forehead settl upon bridg nose

if man could afford buy expens hat three year ago hat since assur gone world
well clear enough certainly
but foresight moral retrogression
sherlock holm laughed
here foresight said put finger upon littl disc loop hatsecurer
they never sold upon hats
if man order one sign certain amount foresight sinc went way take precaut wind

i nod again
do go asleep life may depend upon it
have pistol readi case need it
i sit side bed chair
i took revolv laid corner table
holm brought long thin cane place upon bed besid him
by laid box match stump candle
then turn lamp left darkness
how shall i ever forget dread vigil
i could hear sound even draw breath yet i knew companion sat openeyed within feet me state nervous tension i myself
the shutter cut least ray light wait absolut darkness
from outsid came occasion cri nightbird window long drawn catlik whine told us cheetah inde liberty

but i saw nothing
at moment holm struck light i heard low clear whistle sudden glare flash weari eye made imposs tell friend lash savagely
i could however see face dead pale fill horror loathing
he ceas strike gaze ventil sudden broke silenc night horribl cri i ever listened

the rapid poison would take effect would also point view advantage
it would sharpey coroner indeed could distinguish two littl dark punctur would show poison fang done work
then i thought whistle
