in case certain so i replied littl thought
the thing however is say simplest

the thing seem deeper inexplicable
how example could describ confid woodenleg man
pshaw dear boy
simplic itself
i dont wish theatrical
it patent aboveboard
two offic command convictguard learn import secret buri treasure
a map drawn englishman name jonathan small
you rememb saw name upon chart captain morstan possession
he sign behalf associatesth sign four somewhat dramat call it
aid chart officersor one themget treasur bring england leaving suppose condit receiv unfulfilled
now then jonathan small get treasur himself
the answer obvious
the chart date time morstan brought close associ convicts
jonathan small get treasur associ convict could get away
but mere speculation said i it that
it hypothesi cover facts
let us see fit sequel
major sholto remain peac years happi possess treasure
then receiv letter india give great fright
what that
a letter say men wrong set free
or escaped
that much likely would known term imprison was
it would surpris him
what then
he guard woodenleg mana white man mark you mistak white tradesman him actual fire pistol him
now one white man name chart
the other hindoo mohammedans
there white man
therefor may say confid woodenleg man ident jonathan small
doe reason strike faulty
no clear concise
well now let us put place jonathan small
let us look point view
he come england doubl idea regain would consid right reveng upon man wrong him
he found sholto lived possibl establish communic one insid house
there butler lal rao seen
mrs bernston give far good character
small could find out however treasur hid one ever knew save major one faith servant died

mad hate however dead man enter room night search privat paper hope discov memorandum relat treasure final leav momento visit short inscript upon card
he doubtless plan beforehand slay major would leav record upon bodi sign common murder but point view four associates someth natur act justice
whimsic bizarr conceit kind common enough annal crime usual afford valuabl indic criminal
do follow this
veri clearly
now could jonathan small do
he could continu keep secret watch upon effort made find treasure
possibl leav england come back intervals
then come discoveri garret instant inform it
we trace presenc confeder household
jonathan wooden leg utter unabl reach lofti room bartholomew sholto
he take him however rather curious associate get difficulty dip nake foot creasote whenc come toby sixmil limp halfpay offic damag tendo achillis
but associate jonathan commit crime
quit so
and rather jonathan disgust judg way stamp got room
he bore grudg bartholomew sholto would prefer could simpli bound gagged
he wish put head halter
there help it however savag instinct companion broken out poison done work jonathan small left record lower treasurebox ground follow himself

it seem littl weak said i it probabl arrang affair ever set upon expedition
no i hard think so
this lair would valuabl retreat case need give sure could without it
but second consider struck me
jonathan small must felt peculiar appear companion howev much may topcoat him would give rise gossip possibl associ norwood tragedy
he quit sharp enough see that
they start headquart cover darkness would wish get back broad light
now past three oclock accord mrs smith got boat
it would quit bright peopl would hour so

they could taken lodgings
quit so
i argu launch must great way off spite invisibility
