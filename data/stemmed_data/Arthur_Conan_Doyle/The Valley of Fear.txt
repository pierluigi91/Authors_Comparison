veri good
here man slip hous deliber intent commit murder
he knows know anything deeficulti make escape hous surround water
what weapon would choose
you would say silent world
then could hope deed done slip quick window wade moat get away leisure
that understandable
but understand go way bring noisi weapon could select know well fetch everi human hous spot quick run odd
is credible mr holmes
well put case strongly friend repli thoughtfully
it certain need good deal justification
may i ask mr white mason whether examin farther side moat see sign man climb water
there signs mr holmes
but stone ledge one could hard expect them
no track marks
none
ha
would objection mr white mason go hous once
there may possibl small point might suggestive
i go propos it mr holmes i thought well put touch fact go
i suppos anyth strike you white mason look doubt amateur
i work mr holm before said inspector macdonald
he play game
mi idea game rate said holmes smile
i go case help end justic work police
if i ever separ offici force first separ me
i wish ever score expense
at time mr white mason i claim right work way give result timecomplet rather stages
i sure honour presenc show know said white mason cordially
come along dr watson time come well hope place book
we walk quaint villag street row pollard elm side it
just beyond two ancient stone pillars weatherstain lichenblotched bear upon summit shapeless someth rampant lion capus birlstone
a short walk along wind drive sward oak around one see rural england sudden turn long low jacobean hous dingy livercolour brick lay us oldfashion garden cut yew
as approach it wooden drawbridg beauti broad moat still lumin quicksilv cold winter sunshine
three centuri flow past old manor house centuri birth homecomings countri danc meet fox hunters
strang old age dark busi cast shadow upon vener walls
and yet strange peak roof quaint overhung gabl fit cover grim terribl intrigue
as i look deepset window long sweep dullcoloured waterlap front i felt fit scene could set tragedy
that window said white mason that one immedi right drawbridge
it open found last night
it look rather narrow man pass
well wasnt fat man anyhow
we dont need deductions mr holmes tell us that

holm walk edg moat look across

he solid grip fact cool clear commonsens brain take way profession
holm listen intently sign impati offici expon often produced
is suicide murderthat first question gentlemen not
if suicide believ man began take wed ring conceal it came dress gown trampl mud corner behind curtain order give idea someon wait
so i think
suicid question
then murder done
what determin is whether done someon outsid insid house
well let hear argument
there consider difficulti ways yet one must be
we suppos first person person insid hous crime
they got man time everyth still yet one asleep
they deed queerest noisiest weapon world tell everyon happeneda weapon never seen hous before
that seem like start it
no not
well then everyon agre alarm given minut pass whole householdnot mr cecil barker alone though claim first ame spot
do tell time guilti person manag make footmark corner open window mark sill blood take wed ring dead man finger rest it
it impossible

well then driven back theori done someon outside
we still face big difficulties anyhow ceas impossibilities
the man got hous fourthirti six say dusk time bridg raised
there visitors door open noth prevent him
he may common burglar may privat grudg mr douglas

you think come that
he cheer debonair humour
mi dear watson i extermin fourth egg i shall readi put touch whole situation
i dont say fathom itfar itbut trace miss dumbbell the dumbbell
dear me watson possibl penetr fact case hang upon miss dumbbell
well well need downcast i dont think either inspector mac excel local practition grasp overwhelm import incident
one dumbbell watson
consid athlet one dumbbell
pictur unilater development immin danger spinal curvature
shocking watson shocking
he sat mouth full toast eye sparkl mischief watch intellectu entanglement
the mere sight excel appetit assur success i clear recollect day night without thought food baffl mind chafe problem thin eager featur becam
final lit pipe sit inglenook old villag inn talk slowli random case rather one think aloud one make consid statement
a lie watsona great big thumping obtrusive uncompromis liethat meet us threshold
there start point
the whole stori told barker lie
but barker stori corrobor mrs douglas
therefor lie also
they lying conspiracy
so clear problem
whi lying truth tri hard conceal
let us try watson i get behind lie reconstruct truth
how i know lying
becaus clumsi fabric simpli could true
consider
accord stori given us assassin less minut murder commit take ring anoth ring dead man finger replac ringa thing would sure never
i say obvious impossible
you may arguebut i much respect judgment watson think sothat ring may taken man killed
the fact candl lit short time show lengthi interview
was douglas hear fearless character man would like give wed ring short notice could conceiv give all
no no watson assassin alon dead man time lamp lit
of i doubt all
but gunshot appar caus death
therefor shot must fire time earlier told
but could mistak matter that
we presence therefore deliber conspiraci upon part two peopl heard gunshotof man barker woman douglas
when top i abl show blood mark windowsil deliber place barker order give fals clue police admit case grow dark him
now ask hour murder actual occur
up halfpast ten servant move house certain time
at quarter eleven gone room except ames pantry
i tri experi left us afternoon i find nois macdonald make studi penetr pantri door shut
it otherwise however housekeep room
it far corridor i could vagu hear voic loud raised
the sound shotgun extent muffl discharg close range undoubt instance
it would loud yet silenc night easili penetr mrs allen room
she is told us somewhat deaf none less mention evid hear someth like door slam half hour alarm given
half hour alarm given would quarter eleven
i doubt heard report gun real instant murder
if so determin barker mrs douglas presum actual murderers could quarter eleven sound shot brought down quarter past eleven rang
what doing instant give alarm
that question face us answer shall sure gone way solv problem
i convinc myself said i that understand two people
she must heartless creatur sit laugh jest within hour husband murder
exactly
she shine wife even account occurred
i wholesoul admir womankind aware watson experi life taught wives regard husbands would let man spoken word stand husband dead
should i ever marry watson i hope inspir wife feel would prevent walk housekeep corps lie within yard her
it bad stagemanaged even rawest investig must struck absenc usual feminin ululation
if noth else incid alon would suggest prearrang conspiraci mind
you think then definitely barker mrs dougla guilti murder
there appal direct questions watson said holmes shake pipe me
they come like bullets
if put mrs dougla barker know truth murder conspir conceal it i give wholesoul answer
i sure do
but dead proposit clear
let us moment consid difficulti stand way
we suppos coupl unit bond guilti love determin get rid man stand them
it larg supposition discreet inquiri among servant other fail corrobor way
on contrary good deal evid douglas attach other
that i sure cannot true said i think beauti smile face garden
well least gave impression
however suppos extraordinarili astut couple deceiv everyon upon point conspir murder husband
he happen man whose head danger hangs we word that
holm look thoughtful
i see watson
you sketch theori everyth say begin false
accord idea never hidden menace secret society valley fear boss macsomebody anyth else
well good sweep generalization
let us see bring us to
they invent theori account crime
they play idea leav bicycl park proof exist outsider
the stain windowsil convey idea
so card body might prepar house
that fit hypothesis watson
but come nasty angular uncompromis bit wont slip places
whi cutoff shotgun weaponsand american one that
how could sure sound would bring someon them
it mere chanc mrs allen start inquir slam door
whi guilti coupl this watson
i confess i cant explain it
then again woman lover conspir murder husband go advertis guilt ostentati remov wed ring death
doe strike probable watson
no not
and again thought leav bicycl conceal outsid occur you would realli seem worth dullest detect would natur say obvious blind bicycl first thing
i conceiv explanation
and yet combin event wit man cannot conceiv explanation
simpli mental exercise without assert true let indic possibl line thought
it is i admit mere imagination often imagin mother truth
we suppos guilti secret realli shame secret life man douglas
this lead murder someon is suppose avenger someon outside
this avenger reason i confess i still loss explain took dead man wed ring
the vendetta might conceiv date back man first marriage ring taken reason
befor aveng got away barker wife reach room
the assassin convinc attempt arrest would lead public hideous scandal
they convert idea prefer let go
for purpos probabl lower bridge done quit noiselessly rais again
he made escape reason thought could safe foot bicycle
he therefor left machin would discov got safe away
so far within bound possibility not
well possible doubt said i reserve
we remember watson whatev occur certain someth extraordinary
well now continu supposititi case couplenot necessarili guilti coupler murder gone place posit may difficult prove
they rapid rather clumsili met situation
the mark put barker bloodstain slipper upon windowsil suggest fugit got away
they obvious two must heard sound gun gave alarm exact would done good half hour event
and propos prove this
well outsider may trace taken
that would effect proofs
but notwell resourc scienc far exhausted
i think even alon studi would help much
an even alone
i propos go presently
i arrang estim ames mean wholeheart barker
i shall sit room see atmospher bring inspiration
im believ genius loci
you smile friend watson
