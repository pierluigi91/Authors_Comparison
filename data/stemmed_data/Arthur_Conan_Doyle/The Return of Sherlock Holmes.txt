it time sought professor moriarty time chief staff
moriarti suppli liber money use one two highclass jobs ordinari crimin could undertaken
you may recollect death mrs stewart lauder

he rush road but although sever passersbi declar notic man run shop could neither see anyon could find mean identifi rascal
it seem one senseless act hooligan occur time time report constabl beat such
the plaster cast worth shillings whole affair appear childish particular investigation
the second case however serious also singular
it occur last night
in kennington road within hundr yard mors hudson shop live wellknown medic practitioner name dr barnicot one largest practic upon south side thames
his resid princip consultingroom kennington road branch surgeri dispensari lower brixton road two mile away
