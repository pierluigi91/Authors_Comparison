the idea use decoy clear alreadi mind though may certain detail plot arranged
he meant end estate readi use tool run risk end
his first act establish near ancestr home could second cultiv friendship sir charl baskervill neighbours
the baronet told famili hound prepar way death
stapleton i continu call him knew old man heart weak shock would kill him
so much learn dr mortimer
he heard also sir charl superstiti taken grim legend seriously
his ingeni mind instant suggest way baronet could done death yet would hard possibl bring home guilt real murderer

the old gentleman could decoy outsid ground night

so much death sir charl baskerville
you perceiv devilish cun it realli would almost imposs make case real murderer
his accomplic one could never give away grotesque inconceiv natur devic serv make effective
both women concern case mrs stapleton mrs laura lyons left strong suspicion stapleton
mrs stapleton knew design upon old man also exist hound
mrs lyon knew neither things impress death occur time uncancel appoint known him
however influence noth fear them
the first half task success accomplish difficult still remained
it possibl stapleton know exist heir canada
in case would soon learn friend dr mortimer told latter detail arriv henri baskerville
stapleton first idea young stranger canada might possibl done death london without come devonshir all
he distrust wife ever sinc refus help lay trap old man dare leav long sight fear lose influenc her
it reason took london him
they lodged i find mexborough privat hotel craven street actual one call upon agent search evidence
here kept wife imprison room he disguis beard follow dr mortim baker street afterward station northumberland hotel
his wife inkl plans fear husbanda fear found upon brutal illtreatmentthat dare write warn man knew danger
if letter fall stapleton hand life would safe
eventually know adopt expedi cut word would form message address letter disguis hand
it reach baronet gave first warn danger
it essenti stapleton get articl sir henri attir that case driven use dog might alway mean set upon track
with characterist prompt audac set once cannot doubt boot chambermaid hotel well bribe help design
by chance however first boot procur new one and therefore useless purpose
he return obtain anothera instruct incident sinc prove conclus mind deal real hound supposit could explain anxieti obtain old boot indiffer
the outr grotesqu incid care deserv examined point appear complic case is duli consid scientif handled one like elucid it
then visit friend next morning shadow alway stapleton cab
from knowledg room appearance well general conduct i inclin think stapleton career crime mean limit singl baskervill affair
it suggest last three year four consider burglari west country none crimin ever arrested
the last these folkeston court may remark coldblood pistol page surpris mask solitari burglar
i cannot doubt stapleton recruit wane resourc fashion year desper danger man
we exampl readi resourc morn got away us successfully also audac send back name cabman
from moment understood i taken case london therefor chanc there
he return dartmoor await arriv baronet
one moment
said i you have doubt describ sequenc event correctly one point left unexplained
what becam hound master london
i given attent matter undoubt importance
there question stapleton confidant though unlik ever place power share plan him
there old manserv merripit house whose name anthony
his connect stapleton trace sever years far back schoolmast days must awar master mistress realli husband wife
this man disappear escap country
it suggest anthoni common name england antonio spanish spanishamerican countries
the man like mrs stapleton herself spoke good english curious lisp accent
i seen old man cross grimpen mire path stapleton mark out
it probable therefore absenc master care hound though may never known purpos beast used
the stapleton went devonshire whither soon follow sir henri you
one word i stood time
it may possibl recur memori i examin paper upon print word fasten i made close inspect watermark
in i held within inch eyes conscious faint smell scent known white jessamine
there seventyf perfumes necessari crimin expert abl distinguish other case within experi depend upon prompt recognition
the scent suggest presenc lady alreadi thought began turn toward stapletons
thus i made certain hound guess crimin ever went west country
it game watch stapleton
it evident however i could i you sinc would keen guard
i deceiv everybody therefore included i came secret i suppos london
my hardship great imagined though trifl detail must never interfer investig case
i stay part coomb tracey use hut upon moor necessari near scene action
cartwright come me disguis countri boy great assist me
i depend upon food clean linen
when i watch stapleton cartwright frequent watch you i abl keep hand upon strings
i alreadi told report reach rapidly forward instant baker street coomb tracey
they great servic me especi one incident truth piec biographi stapletons
i abl establish ident man woman knew last exact i stood
the case consider complic incid escap convict relat barrymores
this also clear effect way though i alreadi come conclus observations
bi time discov upon moor i complet knowledg whole business i case could go jury
even stapleton attempt upon sir henri night end death unfortun convict help us much prove murder man
there seem altern catch redhanded use sir henry alon appar unprotected bait
we so cost sever shock client succeed complet case drive stapleton destruction
that sir henri expos is i must confess reproach manag case mean forese terribl paralyz spectacl beast presented could predict fog enabl
we succeed object cost specialist dr mortim assur temporari one
a long journey may enabl friend recov shatter nerv also wound feelings
his love ladi deep sincere saddest part black busi deceiv her
it remain indic part play throughout
there doubt stapleton exercis influenc may love may fear possibl both sinc mean incompat emotions
it was least absolut effective
at command consent pass sister though found limit power endeavour make direct accessori murder
she readi warn sir henri far could without implic husband tri so
stapleton seem capabl jealousy saw baronet pay court lady even though part plan still could help interrupt passion outburst reveal fieri soul
by encourag intimaci made certain sir henri would frequent come merripit hous would sooner later get opportun desired
on day crisis however wife turn sudden him
she learn someth death convict knew hound kept outhous even sir henri come dinner
she tax husband intend crime furious scene follow show first time rival love
her fidel turn instant bitter hatred saw would betray him
he tie up therefore might chanc warn sir henry hoped doubt whole countrysid put baronet death curs family certain would do could win wife back accept
in i fanci case made miscalculation that there doom would none less sealed
a woman spanish blood condon injuri lightly
and now dear watson without refer notes i cannot give detail account curious case
i know anyth essenti left unexplained
he could hope frighten sir henri death done old uncl bogi hound
the beast savag halfstarved
if appear frighten victim death least would paralyz resist might offered
no doubt
there remain one difficulty
if stapleton came succession could explain fact he heir live unannounc anoth name close property
how could claim without caus suspicion inquiry
it formid difficulty i fear ask much expect solv it
the past present within field inquiry man may futur hard question answer
mrs stapleton heard husband discuss problem sever occasions
there three possibl courses
he might claim properti south america establish ident british author obtain fortun without ever come england all might adopt elabor disguis short time need
we cannot doubt know would found way difficulty
and now dear watson week sever work one evening i think may turn thought pleasant channels
i box les huguenots
 have heard de reszkes
might i troubl readi half hour stop marcini littl dinner way
