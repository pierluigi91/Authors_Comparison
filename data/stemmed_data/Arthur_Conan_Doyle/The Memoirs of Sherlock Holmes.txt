i found hand faker took liberti run sent over
mi dear sir done wonders
the hors look fit well
it never went better life
i owe thousand apolog doubt ability
you done great servic recov horse
you would greater still could lay hand murder john straker
i done so said holm quietly
the colonel i stare amazement
you got him
where he then
he here
here

in compani present moment
the colonel flush angrily
i quit recogn i oblig you mr holmes said he but i must regard said either bad joke insult
sherlock holm laughed
i assur i associ crime colonel said he
the real murder stand immedi behind you
he step past laid hand upon glossi neck thoroughbred

but goe bell i stand win littl next race i shall defer lengthi explan fit time
we corner pullman car even whirl back london i fanci journey short one colonel ross well myself listen companion narrat event occur
i confess said he that theori i form newspap report entir erroneous
and yet indic there overlaid detail conceal true import
i went devonshir convict fitzroy simpson true culprit although course i saw evid mean complete
it i carriage reach trainer house immens signific curri mutton occur me
you may rememb i distrait remain sit alighted
i marvel mind i could possibl overlook obvious clue
i confess said colonel that even i cannot see help us
it first link chain reasoning
powder opium mean tasteless
the flavor disagreeable perceptible
were mix ordinari dish eater would undoubt detect it would probabl eat more
a curri exact medium would disguis taste
by possibl supposit could stranger fitzroy simpson caus curri serv trainer famili night sure monstrous coincid suppos happen come along powder opium upon
that unthinkable
therefor simpson becom elimin case attent center upon straker wife two peopl could chosen curri mutton supper night
the opium ad dish set asid stableboy other supper ill effects
which them then access dish without maid see them
befor decid question i grasp signific silenc dog one true infer invari suggest others
the simpson incid shown dog kept stables yet though one fetch horse bark enough arous two lad loft
obvious midnight visitor one dog knew well
i alreadi convinced almost convinced john straker went stabl dead night took silver blaze
for purpose
for dishonest one obviously drug stableboy
and yet i loss know why
there case trainer made sure great sum money lay horses agents prevent win fraud
sometim pull jockey
sometim surer subtler means
what here
i hope content pocket might help form conclusion
and so
you cannot forgotten singular knife found dead man hand knife certain sane man would choos weapon
it was dr watson told us form knife use delic oper known surgery
and use delic oper night
you must know wide experi turf matters colonel ross possibl make slight nick upon tendon hors ham subcutaneously leav absolut trace
a hors treat would develop slight lameness would put strain exercis touch rheumatism never foul play
villain
