she could hard determin expect event realli was though earnest tri drive away notion possibl end otherwis last marriag edward lucy
what mrs ferrar would say do though could doubt nature anxious hear still anxious know edward would conduct himself
for him felt much compassionfor luci littleand cost pain procur littlefor rest parti none all
as mrs jen could talk subject elinor soon saw necess prepar mariann discussion
no time lost undeceiv her make acquaint real truth endeavour bring hear talk others without betray felt uneasi sister resent edward
elinor offic pain one
she go remov realli believ sister chief consolationto give particular edward fear would ruin ever good opinionand make marianne resembl situations her
but unwelcom task must be necessari done elinor therefor hasten perform it
she far wish dwell feelings repres suffer much otherwis selfcommand practis sinc first knowledg edward engagement might suggest hint practic
her narrat clear simple though could given without emotion accompani violent agitation impetu grief
that belong rather hearer mariann listen horror cri excessively
elinor comfort other distresses less theirs comfort could given assur composur mind earnest vindic edward everi charg imprudence
but mariann time would give credit neither
edward seem second willoughby acknowledg elinor did had love sincerely could feel less herself
as luci steele consid total unamiable absolut incap attach sensibl man could persuad first believe afterward pardon former affect edward her
she would even admit natural elinor left convinc so could convinc her better knowledg mankind
her first communic reach farther state fact engagement length time existed
mariann feel broken in put end regular detail time could done sooth distress lessen alarms combat resentment
the first question side led farther particulars was how long known you elinor
written you
i known four months
when luci first came barton park last november told confid engagement
at words mariann eye express astonish lip could utter
after paus wonder exclaimed four months

mariann seem much struck
i often wish undec mother ad elinor and twice i attempt itbut without betray trust i never could convinc you

but i love himand comfort other dear me i glad spare know much i felt
now i think speak littl emotion
i would suffer account i assur i longer suffer materi myself
i mani thing support me
i conscious provok disappoint imprud own i born much possibl without spread farther
i acquit edward essenti misconduct
i wish happy i sure alway duty though may harbour regret end must becom so
luci want sense foundat everi thing good may built
and all marianne bewitch idea singl constant attachment said one happi depend entir particular person meantit fitit possibl
 edward marri lucy marri woman superior person understand half sex time habit teach forget ever thought anoth superior her
 if way thinking said marianne if loss valu easili made someth else resolution selfcommand are perhaps littl less wonder at
they brought within comprehension
i understand you
you suppos i ever felt much
for four months marianne i hang mind without liberti speak singl creature know would make mother unhappi whenev explain you yet unabl prepar

 this person suspicions therefore i oppose endeavour appear indiffer i deepli interestedand oncei hope exult listen again
 i known divid edward ever without hear one circumst could make less desir connection
noth prove unworthy anyth declar indiffer me
 i contend unkind sister insol mother suffer punish attachment without enjoy advantages
 and go time when know well unhappiness

becaus merit cri upon myself i tri away
the tenderest caress follow confession
in frame mind in elinor difficulti obtain whatev promis required request mariann engag never speak affair one least appear bitternessto meet luci
 these great concessionsbut mariann felt injured repar could much make
she perform promis discreet admiration
she attend mrs jen say upon subject unchang complexion dissent nothing heard three time say yes maam
she listen prais luci move one chair another mrs jen talk edward affection cost spasm throat
such advanc toward heroism sister made elinor feel equal thing herself
the next morn brought farther trial it visit brother came serious aspect talk dread affair bring news wife
you heard i suppose said great solemnity soon seated of shock discoveri took place roof yesterday
they look assent seem aw moment speech
your sister continued has suffer dreadfully
mrs ferrar tooin short scene complic distressbut i hope storm may weather without us quit overcome

while truest affect plan elig connect him suppos could time secret engag anoth person
such suspicion could never enter head
if suspect ani prepossess elsewhere could that quarter
there sure said she i might thought safe

we consult together however done last determin send edward
he came
but i sorri relat ensued
all mrs ferrar could say make put end engagement assist may well suppos arguments fanni entreaties avail
