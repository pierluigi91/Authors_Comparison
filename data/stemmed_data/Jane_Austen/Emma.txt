but mr weston almost old man
mr weston must forti fifty
which make good manner valuable
the older person grows harriet import manner bad glare disgust loudness coarseness awkward becomes
what passabl youth detest later age
mr martin awkward abrupt mr weston time life
there saying indeed repli harriet rather solemnly
