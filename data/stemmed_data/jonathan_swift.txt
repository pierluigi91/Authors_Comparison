the author veracity
his design publish work
his censur travel swerv truth
the author clear sinist end writing
an object answered
the method plant colonies
his nativ countri commended
the right crown countri describ author justified
the difficulti conquer them
the author take last leav reader propos manner live future give good advice concludes
thus gentl reader i given thee faith histori travel sixteen year seven months wherein i studious ornament truth
i could perhaps like others astonish thee strang improb tales i rather chose relat plain matter fact simplest manner style princip design inform amus thee
it easi us travel remot countries seldom visit englishmen europeans form descript wonder anim sea land
wherea travel chief aim make men wiser better improv mind bad well good exampl deliv concern foreign places
i could heartili wish law enacted everi traveller permit publish voyages oblig make oath lord high chancellor intend print absolut true best knowledge
i perus sever book travel great delight younger days sinc gone part globe abl contradict mani fabul account observation given great disgust part
therefore sinc acquaint pleas think poor endeavour might unaccept country i impos myself maxim never swerv from i would strict adher truth neither inde i ever least
nec si miserum fortuna sinonem finxit vanum etiam mendacemqu improba finget
i know well littl reput got write requir neither genius learning inde talent except good memory exact journal
i know likewise writer travels like dictionarymakers sunk oblivion weight bulk come last therefor lie uppermost
and high probable travellers shall hereaft visit countri describ work mine may detect error if any ad mani new discoveri own justl vogue stand
this inde would great mortification i wrote fame sole intent public good i cannot altogeth disappointed
for read virtu i mention glorious houyhnhnms without asham vices consid reasoning govern anim country
i shall say noth remot nation yahoos preside among least corrupt brobdingnagians whose wise maxim moral govern would happi observe
but i forbear descant further rather leav judici reader remark application
i littl pleas work mine possibl meet censurers object made writer relat plain facts happen distant countries least interest
i care avoid everi fault common writer travel often just charged
besides i meddl least party write without passion prejudice illwil man number men whatsoever
i write noblest end inform instruct mankind i may without breach modesty pretend superiority advantag i receiv convers long among accomplish houyhnhnms
i write without view profit praise
i never suffer word pass may look like reflection possibl give least offence even readi take it
so i hope i may justic pronounc author perfect blameless tribe answerers considerers observers reflectors detectors remarkers never abl find matter exercis talents
i confess whisper me that i bound duty subject england given memori secretari state first come over because whatev land discov subject belong crown
but i doubt whether conquest countri i treat would easi ferdinando cortez nake americans
the lilliputians i think hard worth charg fleet armi reduc them i question whether might prudent safe attempt brobdingnagians whether english armi would much eas fli island
the houyhnhnms inde appear well prepar war scienc perfect strangers especi missiv weapons
however suppos minist state i could never give advic invad them
their prudence unanimity unacquainted fear love country would ampli suppli defect militari art
imagin twenti thousand break midst european army confound ranks overturn carriages batter warrior face mummi terribl yerk hinder hoofs would well deserv charact
but instead propos conquer magnanim nation i rather wish capacity disposition send suffici number inhabit civil europe teach us first principl honour justice truth
the name virtu still retain among us languages met modern well ancient authors i abl assert small reading
but i anoth reason made less forward enlarg majesti dominion discoveries
to say truth i conceiv scrupl relat distribut justic princ upon occasions
for instance crew pirat driven storm know whither length boy discov land topmast go shore rob plunder see harmless people entertain kindness give countri new name
here commenc new dominion acquir titl divin right
ship sent first opportunity nativ driven destroyed princ tortur discov gold free licens given act inhuman lust earth reek blood inhabitants execr
but description i confess mean affect british nation may exampl whole world wisdom care justic plant colonies liber endow advanc religion learning
but countri i describ appear desir conquer enslaved murder driven colonies abound either gold silver sugar tobacco i humbl conceive mean proper
however concern think fit anoth opinion i readi depose i shall law called european ever visit countri me
i mean inhabit ought believed unless disput may aris concern two yahoos said seen mani year ago upon mountain houyhnhnmland
but formal take possess sovereign name never came thoughts had yet affair stood i perhaps point prudenc selfpreservation put better
have thus answer object ever rais traveller i take final leav courteous readers return enjoy specul littl garden redriff appli excel lesson
i began last week permit wife sit dinner me farthest end long table answer but utmost brevity question i ask her
yet smell yahoo continu offensive i alway keep nose well stop rue lavender tobacco leaves
and although hard man late life remov old habits i altogeth hopes time suffer neighbour yahoo company without apprehens i yet teeth claws
my reconcil yahoo kind general might difficult would content vice folli natur entitl to
i least provok sight lawyer pickpocket colonel fool lord gamester politician whoremonger physician evidence suborner attorney traitor like accord due cours
the wise virtuous houyhnhnms abound excel adorn ration creature name vice language term express thing evil except wherebi describ detest
but i experience could plain observ rudiment among wild yahoos
but houyhnhnms live govern reason proud good qualiti possess i want leg arm man wit would boast of although must miser without them
i dwell longer upon subject desir i make societi english yahoo mean insupportable therefor i entreat tinctur absurd vice presum come
