Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus by Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley Letter 1 St. Petersburgh, Dec.
11th, 17-- TO Mrs. Saville, England You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings.
I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.
I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight.
Do you understand this feeling?
This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid.
I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight.
There, Margaret, the sun is forever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.
There--for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators--there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the
Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes.
What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?
I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever.
I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.
These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery
But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are
These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose--a point on which the soul
This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.
I have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole.
You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas' library.
My education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading.
These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.
These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.
I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.
You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.
But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.
Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.
I can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise.
I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.
I accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the
Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration.
I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.
And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?
My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path.
Oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative!
My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed.
I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.
This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.
They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.
The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs--a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in
I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.
I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to
I do not intend to sail until the month of June; and when shall I return?
Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?
If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet.
If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.
Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret.
Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness.
Your affectionate brother, R. Walton Letter 2 Archangel, 28th March, 17-- To Mrs. Saville, England How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!
Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.
I have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.
But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my
I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling.
I desire the company of a man who could sympathize with me, whose eyes would reply to mine.
You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend.
I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans.
How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother!
I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties.
But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas' books of voyages.
At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more
Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.
It is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters call it) KEEPING; and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me
Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen.
Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these rugged bosoms.
My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession.
He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity.
I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.
The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline.
This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made me very desirous to engage him.
A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to
I heard of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life.
This, briefly, is his story.
Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match.
He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never
My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit.
He had already bought a farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young woman's
But the old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations.
"What a noble fellow"!
you will exclaim.
He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command.
Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in my resolutions.
Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.
The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected.
I shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.
I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking.
It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart.
I am going to unexplored regions, to "the land of mist and snow," but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the "Ancient Mariner".
You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret.
I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets.
There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
I am practically industrious--painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labour--but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of
But to return to dearer considerations.
Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America?
I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture.
Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits.
I love you very tenderly.
Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.
Your affectionate brother, Robert Walton Letter 3 July 7th, 17-- To Mrs. Saville, England My dear Sister, I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe--and well advanced on my voyage.
This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not see my native land, perhaps, for many years.
I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them.
We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating
No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter.
One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and I shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.
Adieu, my dear Margaret.
Be assured that for my own sake, as well as yours, I will not rashly encounter danger.
I will be cool, persevering, and prudent.
But success SHALL crown my endeavours.
Wherefore not?
Thus far I have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph.
Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?
What can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man?
My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.
But I must finish.
Heaven bless my beloved sister!
R.W. Letter 4 August 5th, 17-- To Mrs. Saville, England So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession.
Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated.
Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog.
We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.
About two o'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end.
Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation.
We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.
We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.
This appearance excited our unqualified wonder.
We were, as we believed, many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed.
Shut in, however, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the greatest attention.
About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship.
We, however, lay to until the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice.
I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.
In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking to someone in the sea.
It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice.
Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European.
When I appeared on deck the master said, "Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea".
On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a foreign accent.
"Before I come on board your vessel," said he, "will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound"?
You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth
I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole.
Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.
Good God!
Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless.
His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering.
I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.
We attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted.
We accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity.
As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove.
By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully.
Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.
When he had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit.
I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is
But he is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.
When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended
Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.
His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, "To seek one who fled from me".
"And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion"?
"Yes".
"Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice".
This aroused the stranger's attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the demon, as he called him, had pursued.
Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, "I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries".
"Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine".
"And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life".
Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge.
I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.
From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.
He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.
I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.
Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day.
The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.
Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him, although they have had very little communication with him.
For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.
He must have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable.
I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.
I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record.
August 13th, 17-- My affection for my guest increases every day.
He excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.
How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief?
He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.
He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own.
Yet, although unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others.
He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise.
He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it.
I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to
One man's life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race.
As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener's countenance.
At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast.
I paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: "Unhappy man!
Do you share my madness?
Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?
Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips"!
Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.
Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally.
He asked me the history of my earlier years.
The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection.
I spoke of my desire of finding a friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.
"I agree with you," replied the stranger; "we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves--such a friend ought to be--do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.
I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship.
You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair.
But I--I have lost everything and cannot begin life anew".
As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled grief that touched me to the heart.
But he was silent and presently retired to his cabin.
Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature.
The starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth.
Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.
Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine wanderer?
You would not if you saw him.
You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.
Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.
I believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are
August 19, 17-- Yesterday the stranger said to me, "You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.
I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me, but you have won me to alter my determination.
You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been.
I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my
Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous.
Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied
You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered communication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes.
I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.
I expressed these feelings in my answer.
"I thank you," he replied, "for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled.
I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace.
I understand your feeling," continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; "but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is
He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I should be at leisure.
This promise drew from me the warmest thanks.
I have resolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during the day.
If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes.
This manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who know him, and who hear it from his own lips--with what interest and sympathy shall I read it in some future day!
Even now, as I commence my task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within.
Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it--thus!
Chapter 1 I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic.
My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation.
He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business.
He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.
As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them.
One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty.
This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence.
Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness.
My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.
He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them.
He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.
Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode.
Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the Reuss.
But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him.
Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant's house.
The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any
His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support.
But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support her in her adversity.
She procured plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.
Several months passed in this manner.
Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar.
This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort's coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber.
He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation.
Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.
There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.
There was a sense of justice in my father's upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly.
Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth.
There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows
Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience.
He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind.
Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through.
During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a
From Italy they visited Germany and France.
I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles.
I remained for several years their only child.
Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me.
My mother's tender caresses and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections.
I was their plaything and their idol, and something better--their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they
With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience,
For a long time I was their only care.
My mother had much desired to have a daughter, but I continued their single offspring.
When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como.
Their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.
This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a passion--remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been relieved--for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted.
During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape.
One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode.
She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes.
Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest.
She appeared of a different stock.
The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair.
Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head.
Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a
The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history.
She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman.
Her mother was a German and had died on giving her birth.
The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse: they were better off then.
They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born.
The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy--one among the schiavi ognor frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country.
He became the victim of its weakness.
Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known.
His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar.
She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.
When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub--a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills.
The apparition was soon explained.
With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her.
They were fond of the sweet orphan.
Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection.
They consulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents' house--my more than sister--the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures.
Everyone loved Elizabeth.
The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight.
On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said playfully, "I have a pretty present for my Victor--tomorrow he shall have it".
And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine--mine to protect, love, and cherish.
All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own.
We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin.
No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me--my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only.
Chapter 2 We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages.
I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute.
Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together.
Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.
She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home --the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons, tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the
While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes.
The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.
Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.
On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country.
We possessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a league from the city.
We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion.
It was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.
I was indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.
Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva.
He was a boy of singular talent and fancy.
He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake.
He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.
He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure.
He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of
No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.
My parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.
We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed.
When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love.
My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately.
I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me.
It was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in
Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral relations of things.
The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.
The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.
Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us.
She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.
And Clerval--could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?
Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end
I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.
Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise,
Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science.
When I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn.
In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa.
I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.
A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my discovery to my father.
My father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said, "Ah!
Cornelius Agrippa!
My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash".
If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the
It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.
But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest avidity.
When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.
I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself.
I have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature.
In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.
Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth.
Those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy's apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.
The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses.
The most learned philosopher knew little more.
He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.
He might dissect, anatomize, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.
I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.
But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more.
I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their disciple.
It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies.
My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child's blindness, added to a student's thirst for knowledge.
Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.
Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!
Nor were these my only visions.
The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake
And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an
When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm.
It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens.
I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.
As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump.
When we visited it the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner.
It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.
I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.
Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity.
On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to
All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies.
It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known.
All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.
By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a
In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.
Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin.
When I look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life--the last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in
Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies.
It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.
It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.
Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction.
Chapter 3 When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.
I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country.
My departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred--an omen, as it were, of my future misery.
Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger.
During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.
She had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety.
She attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper--Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver.
On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event.
On her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her.
She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself.
"My children," she said, "my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union.
This expectation will now be the consolation of your father.
Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children.
Alas!
I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all?
But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world".
She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.
I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.
It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed forever--that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so
These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.
Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection?
And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?
The time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished.
My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.
My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon.
I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks.
It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life.
I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me.
I was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above all, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.
She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.
She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal.
She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins.
Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.
She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.
The day of my departure at length arrived.
Clerval spent the last evening with us.
He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain.
His father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son.
Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education.
He said little, but when he spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce.
We sat late.
We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word "Farewell"!
It was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but when at morning's dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there--my father again to bless me, Clerval to
I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections.
I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure--I was now alone.
In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector.
My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances.
I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and Clerval; these were "old familiar faces," but I believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers.
Such were my reflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose.
I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.
I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.
Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to repent.
I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing.
At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes.
I alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.
The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors.
Chance--or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's door--led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.
He was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science.
He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.
I replied carelessly, and partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors I had studied.
The professor stared.
"Have you," he said, "really spent your time in studying such nonsense"?
I replied in the affirmative.
"Every minute," continued M. Krempe with warmth, "every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost.
You have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names.
Good God!
In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient?
I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.
My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew".
So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures
I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape.
M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits.
In rather a too philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years.
As a child I had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science.
With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten
Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.
It was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now the scene was changed.
The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded.
I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.
Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode.
But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.
And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.
Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after.
This professor was very unlike his colleague.
He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black.
His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.
He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers.
He then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms.
After having made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget: "The ancient teachers of this science," said he, "promised impossibilities and performed nothing.
The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible, have
They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places.
They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe.
They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows".
Such were the professor's words--rather let me say such the words of the fate--enounced to destroy me.
As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one
So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein--more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.
I closed not my eyes that night.
My internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I had no power to produce it.
By degrees, after the morning's dawn, sleep came.
I awoke, and my yesternight's thoughts were as a dream.
There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent.
On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.
His manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public, for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.
I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor.
He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited.
He said that "These were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge.
They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.
The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind".
I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a
I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.
"I am happy," said M. Waldman, "to have gained a disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success.
Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science.
A man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone.
If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics".
He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism.
He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave.
Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.
Chapter 4 From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.
I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.
I attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that
In M. Waldman I found a true friend.
His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.
In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.
My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.
As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid.
My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the masters.
Professor Krempe often asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.
Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make.
None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science.
In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the
When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I
One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life.
Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?
It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries.
I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology.
Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable.
To examine the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death.
I became acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.
In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.
I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit.
Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm.
Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses.
My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.
I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain.
I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me--a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple,
Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.
The sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is true.
Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable.
After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter.
The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture.
After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils.
But this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been progressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.
What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp.
Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished.
I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light.
I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am
I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery.
Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.
When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.
Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour.
I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and
The materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed.
I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present
Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability.
It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being.
As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large.
After having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began.
No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.
Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world.
A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me.
No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs.
Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.
These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour.
My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement.
Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realize.
One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.
Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay?
My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.
It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits.
I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame.
In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my
The dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.
The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit.
It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.
And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time.
I knew my silence disquieted them, and I well remembered the words of my father: "I know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you.
You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected".
I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings, but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.
I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed.
I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame.
A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity.
I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule.
If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind.
If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more
But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.
My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.
Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not watch the blossom or the expanding leaves--sights which before always yielded me supreme delight--so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.
The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded.
But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.
Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime.
Sometimes I grew alarmed at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself both of
Chapter 5 It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils.
With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.
It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive
How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?
His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful.
Beautiful!
Great God!
His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of
The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature.
I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.
For this I had deprived myself of rest and health.
I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.
Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.
At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams.
I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt.
Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her
I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch--the miserable
He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me.
His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.
He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.
I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the
Oh!
No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.
A mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.
I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived.
I passed the night wretchedly.
Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.
Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!
Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour.
The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view.
I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky.
I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.
I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing.
My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me: Like one who, on a lonely road, Doth walk in fear and dread, And, having once turned round, walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he
[Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner".
] Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped.
Here I paused, I knew not why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street.
As it drew nearer I observed that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out.
"My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed he, "how glad I am to see you!
How fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting"!
Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection.
I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy.
I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college.
Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt.
"You may easily believe," said he, "how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my
' But his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge".
"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth".
"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom.
By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself.
But, my dear Frankenstein," continued he, stopping short and gazing full in my face, "I did not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for several nights".
"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that I am at length free".
I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night.
I walked with a quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college.
I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about.
I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.
Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room.
My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself.
I then paused, and a cold shivering came over me.
I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.
I stepped fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest.
I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.
We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself.
It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly.
I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.
Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival, but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter frightened and astonished him.
"My dear Victor," cried he, "what, for God's sake, is the matter?
Do not laugh in that manner.
How ill you are!
What is the cause of all this"?
"Do not ask me," cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; "HE can tell.
Oh, save me!
Save me"!
I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.
Poor Clerval!
What must have been his feelings?
A meeting, which he anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.
But I was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long, long time.
This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months.
During all that time Henry was my only nurse.
I afterwards learned that, knowing my father's advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder.
He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that he could towards them.
But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.
The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was forever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.
Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon
By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend, I recovered.
I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.
It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence.
I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.
"Dearest Clerval," exclaimed I, "how kind, how very good you are to me.
This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room.
How shall I ever repay you?
I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will forgive me".
"You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not"?
I trembled.
One subject!
What could it be?
Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think?
"Compose yourself," said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, "I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting.
They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence".
"Is that all, my dear Henry?
How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love"?
"If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from your cousin, I believe".
Chapter 6 Clerval then put the following letter into my hands.
It was from my own Elizabeth: "My dearest Cousin, "You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.
You are forbidden to write--to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor, is necessary to calm our apprehensions.
For a long time I have thought that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.
I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself!
I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin.
Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed you are getting better.
I eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting.
"Get well--and return to us.
You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly.
Your father's health is vigorous, and he asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.
How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest!
He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit.
He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother returns to us.
My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application.
He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the lake.
I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.
"Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us.
The blue lake and snow-clad mountains--they never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws.
My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me.
Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household.
Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?
Probably you do not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words.
Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third.
This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill.
My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house.
The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.
Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral.
A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England.
Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.
"Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica--she
My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended.
This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.
She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.
"When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection.
Poor Justine was very ill; but other trials were reserved for her.
"One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.
The conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality.
She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived.
Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother.
Poor girl!
She wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity.
Nor was her residence at her mother's house of a nature to restore her gaiety.
The poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance.
She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister.
Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever.
She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter.
Justine has just returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly.
She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.
"I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling William.
I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair.
When he smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with health.
He has already had one or two little WIVES, but Louisa Biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.
"Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of Geneva.
The pretty Miss Mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.
Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn.
Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva.
But he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.
She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody.
"I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude.
Write, dearest Victor,--one line--one word will be a blessing to us.
Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful.
Adieu!
my cousin; take care of your self; and, I entreat you, write!
"Elizabeth Lavenza.
"Geneva, March 18, 17--".
"Dear, dear Elizabeth"!
I exclaimed, when I had read her letter: "I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel".
I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly.
In another fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.
One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the several professors of the university.
In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained.
Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy.
When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms.
Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view.
He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory.
But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors.
M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences.
He soon perceived that I disliked the subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.
What could I do?
He meant to please, and he tormented me.
I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.
I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.
Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.
I thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.
I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often
M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman.
"D--n the fellow"!
cried he; "why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us all.
Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true.
A youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.
--Ay, ay," continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, "M.
Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.
Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time".
M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.
Clerval had never sympathized in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.
He came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself.
Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise.
The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies.
Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.
I did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement.
I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours.
Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country.
When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,--in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart.
How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!
Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable, and my journey was retarded until the ensuing
I felt this delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved friends.
My return had only been delayed so long, from an unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants.
The winter, however, was spent cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.
The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long
I acceded with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.
We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and the conversation of my friend.
Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.
Excellent friend!
how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.
A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.
When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations.
A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy.
The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud.
I was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden.
Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul.
The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion.
At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.
We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy.
My own spirits were high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.
Chapter 7 On my return, I found the following letter from my father:-- "My dear Victor, "You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day
But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.
What would be your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?
And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune?
Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent son?
I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.
"William is dead!
--that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!
Victor, he is murdered!
"I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction.
"Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais.
The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged our walk farther than usual.
It was already dusk before we thought of returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone on before, were not to be found.
We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return.
Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.
"This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house.
He was not there.
We returned again, with torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night; Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.
About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murder's finger was on his neck.
"He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth.
She was very earnest to see the corpse.
At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, 'O God!
I have murdered my darling child!
' "She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty.
When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh.
She told me, that that same evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother.
This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.
We have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!
"Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth.
She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart.
We are all unhappy; but will not that be an additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?
Your dear mother!
Alas, Victor!
I now say, Thank God she did not live to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!
"Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin, but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of festering, the wounds of our minds.
Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies.
"Your affectionate and afflicted father, "Alphonse Frankenstein.
"Geneva, May 12th, 17--".
Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first expressed on receiving new from my friends.
I threw the letter on the table, and covered my face with my hands.
"My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with bitterness, "are you always to be unhappy?
My dear friend, what has happened"?
I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation.
Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.
"I can offer you no consolation, my friend," said he; "your disaster is irreparable.
What do you intend to do"?
"To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses".
During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation; he could only express his heartfelt sympathy.
"Poor William"!
said he, "dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother!
Who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his untimely loss!
To die so miserably; to feel the murderer's grasp!
How much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence!
Poor little fellow!
one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest.
The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.
A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain.
He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable survivors".
Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in solitude.
But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.
My journey was very melancholy.
At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress.
I could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.
I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.
How altered every thing might be during that time!
One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive.
Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.
I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind.
I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, 'the palaces of nature,' were not changed.
By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva.
The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I approached my native town.
I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc.
I wept like a child.
"Dear mountains!
my own beautiful lake!
how do you welcome your wanderer?
Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid.
Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness"?
I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure.
My country, my beloved country!
who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake!
Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me.
Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily.
The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human beings.
Alas!
I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.
It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city.
The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered.
As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.
During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures.
The storm appeared to approach rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its progress.
It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.
I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head.
It was echoed from Saleve, the Juras, and the Alps of Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered
The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.
The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Copet.
Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Mole, a peaked mountain to the east of the lake.
While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step.
This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, "William, dear angel!
this is thy funeral, this thy dirge"!
As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken.
A flash of lightning illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy daemon, to whom I had
What did he there?
Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother?
No sooner did that idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support.
The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.
Nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child.
HE was the murderer!
I could not doubt it.
The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact.
I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Saleve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the south.
He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.
I remained motionless.
The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.
I revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.
Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime?
Alas!
I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?
No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.
But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair.
I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to
Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.
The gates were open, and I hastened to my father's house.
My first thought was to discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be made.
But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell.
A being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.
I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.
I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.
Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it.
And then of what use would be pursuit?
Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Saleve?
These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.
It was about five in the morning when I entered my father's house.
I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising.
Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt.
Beloved and venerable parent!
He still remained to me.
I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the mantel-piece.
It was an historical subject, painted at my father's desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling by the coffin of her dead father.
Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity.
Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.
While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me: "Welcome, my dearest Victor," said he.
"Ah!
I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted.
You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.
--Poor William!
he was our darling and our pride"!
Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother's eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame.
Before, I had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and a not less terrible, disaster.
I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.
"She most of all," said Ernest, "requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched.
But since the murderer has been discovered--" "The murderer discovered!
Good God!
how can that be?
who could attempt to pursue him?
It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.
I saw him too; he was free last night"!
"I do not know what you mean," replied my brother, in accents of wonder, "but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.
No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.
Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime"?
"Justine Moritz!
Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?
But it is wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest"?
"No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, leaves no hope for doubt.
But she will be tried today, and you will then hear all".
He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed for several days.
During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.
The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended.
On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner.
This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied earnestly, "You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.
Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent".
At that instant my father entered.
I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, "Good God,
Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William".
"We do also, unfortunately," replied my father, "for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly".
"My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent".
"If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.
She is to be tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted".
This speech calmed me.
I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.
I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her.
My tale was not one to announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar.
Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world?
We were soon joined by Elizabeth.
Time had altered her since I last beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years.
There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.
She welcomed me with the greatest affection.
"Your arrival, my dear cousin," said she, "fills me with hope.
You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine.
Alas!
who is safe, if she be convicted of crime?
I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do upon my own.
Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.
If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more.
But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little William".
"She is innocent, my Elizabeth," said I, "and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal".
"How kind and generous you are!
every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing".
She wept.
"Dearest niece," said my father, "dry your tears.
If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality".
Chapter 8 We passed a few sad hours until eleven o'clock, when the trial was to commence.
My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court.
During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.
It was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could
Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause!
A thousand times rather would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who
The appearance of Justine was calm.
She was dressed in mourning, and her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her feelings, exquisitely beautiful.
Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity
She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.
When she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated.
A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness.
The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called.
Several strange facts combined against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I had.
She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found.
The woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer.
She returned to the house about eight o'clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him.
When shown the body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.
The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and
Justine was called on for her defence.
As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered.
Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly expressed.
Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice.
"God knows," she said, "how entirely I am innocent.
But I do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable
She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at Chene, a village situated at about a league from Geneva.
On her return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.
She was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom
Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.
It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother.
If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her knowledge.
That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.
Concerning the picture she could give no account.
"I know," continued the unhappy victim, "how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which
But here also I am checked.
I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly.
Did the murderer place it there?
I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?
"I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for hope.
I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my innocence".
Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward.
Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court.
"I am," said she, "the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth.
It may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of her character.
I am well acquainted with the accused.
I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years.
During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures.
She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in
She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother.
For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on her perfect innocence.
She had no temptation for such an action; as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value her".
A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest
She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer.
My own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.
I believed in her innocence; I knew it.
Could the demon who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?
I could not sustain the horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony.
The tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.
I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.
In the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched.
I dared not ask the fatal question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my visit.
The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned.
I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt.
I had before experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart-sickening despair that I then endured.
The person to whom I addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.
"That evidence," he observed, "was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive".
This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?
Had my eyes deceived me?
And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?
I hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.
"My cousin," replied I, "it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape.
But she has confessed".
This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine's innocence.
"Alas"!
said she.
"How shall I ever again believe in human goodness?
Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?
Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder".
Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin.
My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide.
"Yes," said Elizabeth, "I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I cannot go alone".
The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse.
We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees.
She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.
My cousin wept also.
"Oh, Justine"!
said she.
"Why did you rob me of my last consolation?
I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now".
"And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?
Do you also join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer"?
Her voice was suffocated with sobs.
"Rise, my poor girl," said Elizabeth; "why do you kneel, if you are innocent?
I am not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt.
That report, you say, is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment, but your own confession".
"I did confess, but I confessed a lie.
I confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins.
The God of heaven forgive me!
Ever since I was condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was.
He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate.
Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.
What could I do?
In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable".
She paused, weeping, and then continued, "I thought with horror, my sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself
Dear William!
dearest blessed child!
I soon shall see you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to suffer ignominy and death".
"Oh, Justine!
Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.
Why did you confess?
But do not mourn, dear girl.
Do not fear.
I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence.
I will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.
You shall not die!
You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!
No!
No!
I never could survive so horrible a misfortune".
Justine shook her head mournfully.
"I do not fear to die," she said; "that pang is past.
God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst.
I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me.
Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to the will of heaven"!
During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room, where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.
Despair!
Who dared talk of that?
The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such deep and bitter agony.
I gnashed my teeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.
Justine started.
When she saw who it was, she approached me and said, "Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty"?
I could not answer.
"No, Justine," said Elizabeth; "he is more convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit it".
"I truly thank him.
In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.
How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am!
It removes more than half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin".
Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.
She indeed gained the resignation she desired.
But I, the true murderer, felt the never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation.
Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.
Anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish.
We stayed several hours with Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away.
"I wish," cried she, "that I were to die with you; I cannot live in this world of misery".
Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears.
She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half-suppressed emotion, "Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer!
Live, and be happy, and make others so".
And on the morrow Justine died.
Elizabeth's heart-rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer.
My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them.
And when I received their cold answers and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed avowal died away on my lips.
Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.
She perished on the scaffold as a murderess!
From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth.
This also was my doing!
And my father's woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice-accursed hands!
Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears!
Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!
Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with
Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.
Chapter 9 Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.
Justine died, she rested, and I was alive.
The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove.
Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet behind.
Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.
I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.
Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell
This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained.
I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation--deep, dark, deathlike solitude.
My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the
"Do you think, Victor," said he, "that I do not suffer also?
No one could love a child more than I loved your brother"--tears came into his eyes as he spoke--"but is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief?
It is also a duty owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society".
This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my other sensations.
Now I could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.
About this time we retired to our house at Belrive.
This change was particularly agreeable to me.
The shutting of the gates regularly at ten o'clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me.
I was now free.
Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the water.
Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections.
I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly--if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the
But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.
I thought also of my father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?
At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness.
But that could not be.
Remorse extinguished every hope.
I had been the author of unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness.
I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.
There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained behind.
My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived.
When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed.
When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation.
I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I when there have precipitated him to their base.
I wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.
Our house was the house of mourning.
My father's health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events.
Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and
She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects.
The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles.
"When I reflect, my dear cousin," said she, "on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me.
Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and
Yet I am certainly unjust.
Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures.
For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had been her own!
I could not consent to the death of any human being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men.
But she was innocent.
I know, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.
Alas!
Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness?
I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.
William and Justine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and perhaps respected.
But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch".
I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.
I, not in deed, but in effect, was the true murderer.
Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, "My dearest friend, you must calm yourself.
These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are.
There is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble.
Dear Victor, banish these dark passions.
Remember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you.
Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?
Ah!
While we love, while we are true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may reap every tranquil blessing--what can disturb our peace"?
And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart?
Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.
Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffectual.
I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate.
The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.
Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations.
It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows.
My wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix.
I had visited it frequently during my boyhood.
Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.
I performed the first part of my journey on horseback.
I afterwards hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads.
The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.
The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve.
The immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as Omnipotence--and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less
Still, as I ascended higher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.
Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.
But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings.
I passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it.
Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.
This valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed.
The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields.
Immense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage.
Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous dome overlooked the valley.
A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey.
Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and recognized, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood.
The very winds whispered in soothing accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more.
Then again the kindly influence ceased to act--I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection.
Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myself--or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.
At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.
Exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.
For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.
The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion.
Chapter 10 I spent the following day roaming through the valley.
I stood beside the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley.
The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or
These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.
They elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillized it.
In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month.
I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day.
They congregated round me; the unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds--they all gathered round me and bade me be at peace.
Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?
All of soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every thought.
The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends.
Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats.
What were rain and storm to me?
My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert.
I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.
It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.
The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnizing my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life.
I determined to go without a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.
The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain.
It is a scene terrifically desolate.
In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees.
The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient
The pines are not tall or luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.
I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the
Alas!
Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings.
If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us.
We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
We rise; one wand'ring thought pollutes the day.
We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep, Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away; It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow, The path of its departure still is free.
Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow; Nought may endure but mutability!
It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.
For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.
A mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains.
Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.
The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep.
The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.
The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.
From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty.
I remained in a recess of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.
The sea, or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits hung over its recesses.
Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.
My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed, "Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life".
As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance, advancing towards me with superhuman speed.
He bounded over the crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man.
I was troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me, but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.
I perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!
) that it was the wretch whom I had created.
I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat.
He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.
But I scarcely observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.
"Devil," I exclaimed, "do you dare approach me?
And do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?
Begone, vile insect!
Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust!
And, oh!
That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered"!
"I expected this reception," said the daemon.
"All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things!
Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us.
You purpose to kill me.
How dare you sport thus with life?
Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind.
If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends".
"Abhorred monster!
Fiend that thou art!
The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes.
Wretched devil!
You reproach me with your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so negligently bestowed".
My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.
He easily eluded me and said, "Be calm!
I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head.
Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery?
Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.
Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my joints more supple.
But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee.
I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me.
Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due.
Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed.
Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded.
I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend.
Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous".
"Begone!
I will not hear you.
There can be no community between you and me; we are enemies.
Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in which one must fall".
"How can I move thee?
Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion?
Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone?
You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing?
They spurn and hate me.
The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge.
I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge.
These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings.
If the multitude of mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my destruction.
Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?
I will keep no terms with my enemies.
I am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness.
Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.
Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me.
Listen to my tale; when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.
But hear me.
The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.
Listen to me, Frankenstein.
You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.
Oh, praise the eternal justice of man!
Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me, and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands".
"Why do you call to my remembrance," I rejoined, "circumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author?
Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light!
Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!
You have made me wretched beyond expression.
You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not.
Begone!
Relieve me from the sight of your detested form".
"Thus I relieve thee, my creator," he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; "thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor.
Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion.
By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you.
Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain.
The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world, you will have heard my story and can decide.
On you it rests, whether I quit forever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin".
As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed.
My heart was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale.
I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution.
I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.
For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness.
These motives urged me to comply with his demand.
We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock.
The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits.
But I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.
Chapter 11 "It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.
A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses.
By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes.
Darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again.
I walked and, I believe, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.
Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid.
The light became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade.
This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.
This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.
I slaked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.
"It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate.
Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night.
I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.
"Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure.
I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.
[The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder.
It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.
I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground.
No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused.
I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.
"Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other.
I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.
I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes.
I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.
Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.
Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again.
"The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest.
My sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas.
My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another.
I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.
"One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it.
In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.
How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!
I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood.
I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn.
I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire.
The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed.
I reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire.
When night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.
I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep.
"It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.
I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.
I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished.
When night came again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more
I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers.
I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.
"Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger.
When I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied.
In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it.
I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun.
I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country.
A great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground.
"It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.
This was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great curiosity.
Finding the door open, I entered.
An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.
He turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable.
His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me.
But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandemonium appeared to the demons of hell after their sufferings in the lake
I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like.
Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.
"It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant's breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for
How miraculous did this appear!
The huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns.
The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite.
One of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.
The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance
This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it.
My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.
No wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.
"Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man.
As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found.
It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water.
One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that
"Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.
I had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat.
The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.
"Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination.
It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth.
I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel.
The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be.
Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad.
I lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk.
As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence.
Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself.
She followed, and they disappeared.
Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.
"On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood.
In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.
Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture.
In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude.
The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice
It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before.
The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love.
He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet.
He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I
"Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood.
The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.
She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire.
She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots.
After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together.
"The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat.
The meal was quickly dispatched.
The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.
Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures.
One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and
The old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.
"Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human
In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning.
So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man's instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing
"The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest".
Chapter 12 "I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep.
I thought of the occurrences of the day.
What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not.
I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and
"The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.
The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal.
"This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.
The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within.
The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation.
Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.
They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.
"They were not entirely happy.
The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep.
I saw no cause for their unhappiness, but I was deeply affected by it.
If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched.
Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?
They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another's company and
What did their tears imply?
Did they really express pain?
I was at first unable to solve these questions, but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.
"A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree.
Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it.
They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves.
"This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.
I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a
"I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours.
I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.
"I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside.
She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise.
I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden.
"By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment.
I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds.
I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers.
This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it.
But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose.
Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference.
By great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words, 'fire,'
' I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves.
The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was 'father.
' The girl was called 'sister' or 'Agatha,' and the youth 'Felix,' 'brother,' or 'son.
' I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them.
I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as 'good,' 'dearest,' 'unhappy.
' "I spent the winter in this manner.
The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys.
I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends.
The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy.
He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me.
Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father.
It was not thus with Felix.
He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends.
But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.
"I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers.
In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.
Early in the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished
In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him.
At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha.
"This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked.
I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs?
I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I
"I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers--their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool!
At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.
Alas!
I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.
"As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.
From this time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared.
Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.
Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.
"The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters.
This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.
"My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.
During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends.
When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage.
When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix.
I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words 'good spirit,' 'wonderful'; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.
"My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad.
I thought (foolish wretch!
) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people.
When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me.
I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny.
I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me.
I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love.
"These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language.
My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.
It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration.
"The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth.
Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation.
The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees.
Happy, happy earth!
Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome.
My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy".
Chapter 13 "I now hasten to the more moving part of my story.
I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am.
"Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies cloudless.
It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure.
My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty.
"It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour--the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him--that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once
Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.
"It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.
The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil.
Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.
Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends.
On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.
Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.
"Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure;
She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.
She did not appear to understand him, but smiled.
He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.
Some conversation took place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old man's feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.
"I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers.
They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists.
Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian.
Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came.
Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.
Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end.
The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.
"As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early.
When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, 'Good night sweet Safie.
' He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation.
I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.
"The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and
She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods.
"When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it.
She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.
The old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.
"The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.
Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.
"In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and
"My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate
"While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.
"The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney's Ruins of Empires.
I should not have understood the purport of this book had not Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations.
He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors.
Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth.
I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans--of their subsequent degenerating--of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and
I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.
"These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.
Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so vicious and base?
He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike.
To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm.
For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.
"Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.
While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me.
I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.
"The words induced me to turn towards myself.
I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches.
A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few!
And what was I?
Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property.
I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man.
I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs.
When I looked around I saw and heard of none like me.
Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?
"I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge.
Oh, that I had forever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!
"Of what a strange nature is knowledge!
It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock.
I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death--a state which I feared yet did not understand.
I admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather
The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me.
The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me.
Miserable, unhappy wretch!
"Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.
I heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the
"But where were my friends and relations?
No father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing.
From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion.
I had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me.
What was I?
The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.
"I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my
Chapter 14 "Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends.
It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was.
"The name of the old man was De Lacey.
He was descended from a good family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence, respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals.
His son was bred in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction.
A few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.
"The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin.
He was a Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.
He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him.
He was tried and condemned to death.
The injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant; and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.
"Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court.
He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means.
After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the execution of the
Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.
The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth.
Felix rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure
"The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety.
Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness.
"During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover
She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.
"I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.
Before I depart I will give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you.
"Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of Safie, who married her.
The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced.
She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad.
This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to
The prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her.
"The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from Paris.
Felix had procured passports in the name of his father, sister, and himself.
He had previously communicated his plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an obscure part of Paris.
"Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.
"Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he
They conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country.
"The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other plans.
He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state
He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed.
His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.
"The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer.
The plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown into prison.
The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure.
His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved.
This idea was torture to him.
He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris
"He did not succeed.
They remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.
"They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I discovered them.
Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his
"Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.
He could have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.
The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.
"When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country.
The generous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate.
"A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter's apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; he had consequently hired
He intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.
"When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency.
A residence in Turkey was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it.
By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided.
She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination.
Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany.
"She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill.
Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.
She fell, however, into good hands.
The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover".
Chapter 15 "Such was the history of my beloved cottagers.
It impressed me deeply.
I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.
"As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed.
But in giving an account of the progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.
"One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books.
I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.
Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of Paradise Lost, a volume of Plutarch's Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter.
The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.
"I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books.
They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection.
In the Sorrows of Werter, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a never-ending source of speculation and
The gentle and domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were forever alive in my own bosom.
But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep.
The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder.
I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it.
"As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition.
I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener.
I sympathized with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.
'The path of my departure was free,' and there was none to lament my annihilation.
My person was hideous and my stature gigantic.
What did this mean?
Who was I?
What was I?
Whence did I come?
What was my destination?
These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.
"The volume of Plutarch's Lives which I possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics.
This book had a far different effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter.
I learned from Werter's imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.
Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience.
I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas.
But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men.
The cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action.
I read of men concerned in public affairs, governing or massacring their species.
I felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.
Induced by these feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus.
The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different
"But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions.
I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history.
It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting.
I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own.
Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect.
He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.
Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.
"Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.
Soon after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory.
At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence.
It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation.
You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences.
You doubtless recollect these papers.
Here they are.
Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which
I sickened as I read.
'Hateful day when I received life!
' I exclaimed in agony.
'Accursed creator!
Why did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in disgust?
God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance.
Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.
' "These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their
Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship?
I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate.
I postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.
Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day's experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.
"Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage.
The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.
Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants.
They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous.
Increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.
I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade.
"I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely
But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone.
I remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator.
But where was mine?
He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.
"Autumn passed thus.
I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon.
Yet I did not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat.
But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers.
Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer.
They loved and sympathized with one another; and their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them.
The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition.
I dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror.
The poor that stopped at their door were never driven away.
I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it.
"The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life.
My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors.
I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.
I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me.
My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors.
"One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage.
When his children had departed, he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before.
At first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued, thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.
"My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which would decide my hopes or realize my fears.
The servants were gone to a neighbouring fair.
All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my limbs failed me and I sank to the ground.
Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat.
The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage.
"I knocked.
'Who is there?
' said the old man.
'Come in.
' "I entered.
'Pardon this intrusion,' said I; 'I am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.
' "'Enter,' said De Lacey, 'and I will try in what manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.
' "'Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is warmth and rest only that I need.
' "I sat down, and a silence ensued.
I knew that every minute was precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview, when the old man addressed me.
'By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French?
' "'No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only.
I am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.
' "'Are they Germans?
' "'No, they are French.
But let us change the subject.
I am an unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation or friend upon earth.
These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and know little of me.
I am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world forever.
' "'Do not despair.
To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full of brotherly love and charity.
Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.
' "'They are kind--they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me.
I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.
' "'That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot you undeceive them?
' "'I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I feel so many overwhelming terrors.
I tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.
' "'Where do these friends reside?
' "'Near this spot.
' "The old man paused and then continued, 'If you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them.
I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere.
I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.
' "'Excellent man!
I thank you and accept your generous offer.
You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures.
' "'Heaven forbid!
Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.
I also am unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent; judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.
' "'How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?
From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be forever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.
' "'May I know the names and residence of those friends?
' "I paused.
This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me forever.
I struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud.
At that moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors.
I had not a moment to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, 'Now is the time!
Save and protect me!
You and your family are the friends whom I seek.
Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!
' "'Great God!
' exclaimed the old man.
'Who are you?
' "At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and Agatha entered.
Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me?
Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage.
Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick.
I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends the antelope.
But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained.
I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel".
Chapter 16 "Cursed, cursed creator!
Why did I live?
Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed?
I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge.
I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.
"When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings.
I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag-like swiftness.
Oh!
What a miserable night I passed!
The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness.
All, save I, were at rest or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and finding myself unsympathized with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.
"But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair.
There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies?
No; from that moment I declared everlasting war against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.
"The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day.
Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation.
"The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my conclusions.
I had certainly acted imprudently.
It was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children.
I ought to have familiarized the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared for my approach.
But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my party.
"These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams.
The horrible scene of the preceding day was forever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father's feet.
I awoke exhausted, and finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in search of food.
"When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known path that conducted to the cottage.
All there was at peace.
I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose.
That hour passed, the sun mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear.
I trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune.
The inside of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspense.
"Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed from that of my protectors.
Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.
"'Do you consider,' said his companion to him, 'that you will be obliged to pay three months' rent and to lose the produce of your garden?
I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination.
' "'It is utterly useless,' replied Felix; 'we can never again inhabit your cottage.
The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related.
My wife and my sister will never recover from their horror.
I entreat you not to reason with me any more.
Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place.
' "Felix trembled violently as he said this.
He and his companion entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then departed.
I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.
"I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair.
My protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world.
For the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my mind towards injury and death.
When I thought of my friends, of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me.
But again when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.
As night advanced I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage, and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations.
"As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and
I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched.
A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected.
The wind fanned the fire, and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.
"As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.
"And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?
I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible.
At length the thought of you crossed my mind.
I learned from your papers that you were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life?
Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.
You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards this place I resolved to proceed.
"But how was I to direct myself?
I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my only guide.
I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I did not despair.
From you only could I hope for succour, although towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred.
Unfeeling, heartless creator!
You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.
But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form.
"My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense.
It was late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.
I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being.
Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter.
Oh, earth!
How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being!
The mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness.
The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.
Snow fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not.
A few incidents now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered wide from my path.
The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth and the
"I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was secured by night from the view of man.
One morning, however, finding that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring, cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air.
I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long appeared dead, revive within me.
Half surprised by the novelty of these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.
Soft tears again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.
"I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.
Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress.
I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport.
She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream.
I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour, from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore.
She was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled.
On seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood.
I followed speedily, I hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at my body and fired.
I sank to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.
"This was then the reward of my benevolence!
I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone.
The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.
Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.
But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.
"For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received.
The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means of extracting it.
My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction.
My daily vows rose for revenge--a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.
"After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey.
The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.
"But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva.
"It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you.
I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.
"At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy.
Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity.
If, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.
"Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me.
As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his face and said, 'Child, what is the meaning of this?
I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.
' "He struggled violently.
'Let me go,' he cried; 'monster!
Ugly wretch!
You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces.
You are an ogre.
Let me go, or I will tell my papa.
' "'Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.
' "'Hideous monster!
Let me go.
My papa is a syndic--he is M. Frankenstein--he will punish you.
You dare not keep me.
' "'Frankenstein!
you belong then to my enemy--to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.
' "The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.
"I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, 'I too can create desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment
' "As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast.
I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.
In spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me.
For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was forever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose
"Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?
I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them.
"While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty.
A woman was sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health.
Here, I thought, is one of those whose joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me.
And then I bent over her and whispered, 'Awake, fairest, thy lover is near--he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!
' "The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.
Should she indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer?
Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.
The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me--not I, but she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am forever robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone.
The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment!
Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief.
I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress.
She moved again, and I fled.
"For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place, sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries forever.
At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify.
We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition.
I am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me.
My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects.
This being you must create".
Chapter 17 The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply.
But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition.
He continued, "You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being.
This you alone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede".
The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me.
"I do refuse it," I replied; "and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me.
You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes.
Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world.
Begone!
I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent".
"You are in the wrong," replied the fiend; "and instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you.
I am malicious because I am miserable.
Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?
You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me?
You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands.
Shall I respect man when he condemns me?
Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.
But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union.
Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery.
I will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred.
Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth".
A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded-- "I intended to reason.
This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that YOU are the cause of its excess.
If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature's sake I would make peace with the whole kind!
But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized.
What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me.
It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another.
Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel.
Oh!
My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit!
Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request"!
I was moved.
I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.
His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?
He saw my change of feeling and continued, "If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America.
My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.
My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.
We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food.
The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty.
Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire".
"You propose," replied I, "to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions.
How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile?
You will return and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.
This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent".
"How inconstant are your feelings!
But a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?
I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that with the companion you bestow I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places.
My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy!
My life will flow quietly away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker".
His words had a strange effect upon me.
I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred.
I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathize with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.
"You swear," I said, "to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you?
May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge"?
"How is this?
I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer.
If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant.
My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal.
I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded".
I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed.
I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him.
His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with.
After a long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.
Turning to him, therefore, I said, "I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe forever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile".
"I swear," he cried, "by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again.
Depart to your home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear".
Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments.
I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice.
His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed.
I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow.
The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced.
Night was far advanced when I came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain.
The stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me.
I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, "Oh!
Stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness".
These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me.
Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva.
Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensations--they weighed on me with a mountain's weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.
Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the family.
My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak.
I felt as if I were placed under a ban--as if I had no right to claim their sympathies--as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them.
Yet even thus I loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task.
The prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality of life.
Chapter 18 Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and I could not collect the courage to recommence my work.
I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me.
I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition.
I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father's consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of
A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably.
My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine.
At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude.
I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless.
But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.
It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me, "I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself.
And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society.
For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it.
Reserve on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all".
I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued--"I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years.
You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another.
But so blind is the experience of man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it.
You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might become your wife.
Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel".
"My dear father, reassure yourself.
I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely.
I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection.
My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union".
"The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced.
If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us.
But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate.
Tell me, therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnization of the marriage.
We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities.
You are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed.
Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness.
Interpret my words with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity".
I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply.
I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.
Alas!
To me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay.
I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family!
Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground?
I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which I expected peace.
I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking.
The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father's house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I
I knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror.
I was aware also that I should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation.
I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed.
Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness.
My promise fulfilled, the monster would depart forever.
Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery forever.
These feelings dictated my answer to my father.
I expressed a wish to visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply.
After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would,
The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most a year, was the period contemplated.
One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion.
Without previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth, arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasbourg.
This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely, maddening
Nay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe.
If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?
To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return.
My father's age rendered him extremely averse to delay.
For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils--one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union
I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation.
During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure.
But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and would he not accompany me to England?
This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.
I was agonized with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen.
But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his
It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native country.
My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.
It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval--and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman's sedulous attention.
She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent farewell.
I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.
I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me.
Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.
I could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.
After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasbourg, where I waited two days for Clerval.
He came.
Alas, how great was the contrast between us!
He was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day.
He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky.
"This is what it is to live," he cried; "how I enjoy existence!
But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful"!
In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the Rhine.
And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.
I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.
We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasbourg to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.
During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.
We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from Strasbourg, arrived at Mainz.
The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque.
The river descends rapidly and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.
We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible.
This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape.
In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns
We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream.
Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased.
I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger.
And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry?
He felt as if he had been transported to fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man.
"I have seen," he said, "the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and
The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.
Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the recess of the
Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country".
Clerval!
Beloved friend!
Even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving.
He was a being formed in the "very poetry of nature".
His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart.
His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the world-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination.
But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind.
The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:-- ----The sounding cataract Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock, The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, Their colours and their forms, were then to
[Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey".
] And where does he now exist?
Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever?
Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator;--has this mind perished?
Does it now only exist in my memory?
No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.
Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.
I will proceed with my tale.
Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us.
Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.
It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain.
The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story.
We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich--places which I had heard of even in my country.
At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul's towering above all, and the Tower famed in English history.
Chapter 19 London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city.
Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and
If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure.
But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound.
Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace.
But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to my heart.
I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.
But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction.
The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement.
He was also pursuing an object he had long had in view.
His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonization and trade.
In Britain only could he further the execution of his plan.
He was forever busy, and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind.
I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection.
I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.
I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head.
Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.
After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva.
He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided.
Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.
We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February.
We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month.
In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July.
I packed up my chemical instruments and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.
We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.
This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us.
From thence we proceeded to Oxford.
As we entered this city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before.
It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces.
This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of Parliament and liberty.
The memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited.
The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.
If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.
The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of
I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future.
I was formed for peaceful happiness.
During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate
But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what I shall soon cease to be--a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.
We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history.
Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves.
We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell.
For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers.
For an instant I dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.
We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest.
The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native
We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.
The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.
From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland.
I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains.
The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.
Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness.
The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with
"I could pass my life here," said he to me; "and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine".
But he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments.
His feelings are forever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.
We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on.
For my own part I was not sorry.
I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the daemon's disappointment.
He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives.
This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.
I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate.
Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.
When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer.
I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me.
I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.
I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being.
Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.
But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur's Seat, St. Bernard's Well, and the Pentland Hills compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness
But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.
We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew's, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.
But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone.
"Do you," said I, "enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous.
I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper".
Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate.
He entreated me to write often.
"I had rather be with you," he said, "in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence".
Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude.
I did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that he might receive his companion.
With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours.
It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves.
The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare.
Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five miles distant.
On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived.
This I hired.
It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury.
The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges.
I ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty.
As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.
In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.
It was a monotonous yet ever-changing scene.
I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape.
Its hills are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains.
Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.
In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me.
Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work.
It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged.
During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings.
But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.
Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous.
Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor.
Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold.
I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.
In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced.
I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom.
Chapter 20 I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour for the night or
As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing.
Three years before, I was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it forever with the bitterest remorse.
I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness.
He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation.
They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form?
She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species.
Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the daemon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very
Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?
I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their
I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by the light of the moon the daemon at the casement.
A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me.
Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise.
As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery.
I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged.
The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.
I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment.
I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.
Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon.
A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another.
I felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house.
In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to open it softly.
I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain
Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.
Shutting the door, he approached me and said in a smothered voice, "You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you intend?
Do you dare to break your promise?
I have endured toil and misery; I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills.
I have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland.
I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my hopes"?
"Begone!
I do break my promise; never will I create another like yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness".
"Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension.
Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you.
You are my creator, but I am your master; obey"!
"The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is arrived.
Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice.
Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a daemon whose delight is in death and wretchedness?
Begone!
I am firm, and your words will only exasperate my rage".
The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger.
"Shall each man," cried he, "find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?
I had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.
Man!
You may hate, but beware!
Your hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness forever.
Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?
You can blast my other passions, but revenge remains--revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food!
I may die, but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery.
Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.
I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom.
Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict".
"Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.
I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words.
Leave me; I am inexorable".
"It is well.
I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your wedding-night".
I started forward and exclaimed, "Villain!
Before you sign my death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe".
I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation.
In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves.
All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears.
I burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean.
I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me.
Why had I not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife?
But I had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland.
I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.
And then I thought again of his words--"I WILL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT".
That, then, was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny.
In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice.
The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I
The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair.
I left the house, the horrid scene of the last night's contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me.
I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery.
If I returned, it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a daemon whom I had myself created.
I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation.
When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep.
I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.
The sleep into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a
The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet; it contained letters from Geneva, and one
He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise.
He could not any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare.
He besought me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed southwards together.
This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.
Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle those utensils the sight
The next morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory.
The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being.
I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber.
With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones,
Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the daemon.
I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly.
The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.
I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.
Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.
The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land, but I sailed away from them.
I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures.
At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot.
The sky became clouded, but the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising.
But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat.
Clouds hid the moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.
I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably.
The wind was high, and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff.
I found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked.
I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water.
Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind.
I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror.
I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me.
I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me.
I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings.
I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave.
"Fiend," I exclaimed, "your task is already fulfilled"!
I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval--all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions.
This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of closing before me forever, I shudder to reflect on it.
Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers.
But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south.
Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.
How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery!
I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land.
It had a wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation.
I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilized man.
I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory.
As I was in a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment.
Fortunately I had money with me.
As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.
As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several people crowded towards the spot.
They seemed much surprised at my appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm.
As it was, I merely remarked that they spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.
"My good friends," said I, "will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am"?
"You will know that soon enough," replied a man with a hoarse voice.
"Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you".
I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions.
"Why do you answer me so roughly"?
I replied.
"Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably".
"I do not know," said the man, "what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains".
While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly increase.
Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me.
I inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied.
I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, "Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. Kirwin's to give an account of yourself".
"Who is Mr. Kirwin?
Why am I to give an account of myself?
Is not this a free country"?
"Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.
Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night".
This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself.
I was innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town.
I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt.
Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.
I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection.
Chapter 21 I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners.
He looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.
About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o'clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising,
It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below.
He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance.
As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground.
His companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead.
Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold.
They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life.
It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age.
He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.
The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a mist came over my eyes, which obliged me
The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.
The son confirmed his father's account, but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light
A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that
Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold.
They put it into a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone.
Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot
Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of ---- from the place where I had
Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me.
This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described.
I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn.
I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was
I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin.
How can I describe my sensations on beholding it?
I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony.
The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me.
I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on the body, I exclaimed, "Have my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life?
Two I have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my benefactor--" The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.
A fever succeeded to this.
I lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval.
Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror.
Fortunately, as I spoke my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.
Why did I not die?
More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest?
Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb!
Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture?
But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by jailers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.
It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the
This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me.
She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterize that class.
The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathizing in sights of misery.
Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.
"Are you better now, sir"?
said she.
I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, "I believe I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror".
"For that matter," replied the old woman, "if you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!
However, that's none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same".
I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.
The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality.
As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.
The physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second.
Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?
These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness.
He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse.
It is true, he seldom came to see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer.
He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long intervals.
One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death.
I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness.
At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been.
Such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.
His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French, "I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to make you more comfortable"?
"I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving".
"I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.
But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge".
"That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals.
Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me"?
"Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that have lately occurred.
You were thrown, by some surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized immediately, and charged with murder.
The first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path".
As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.
I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say, "Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I
I found several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father.
I instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.
But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind".
"This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am now to lament"?
"Your family is perfectly well," said Mr. Kirwin with gentleness; "and someone, a friend, is come to visit you".
I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires.
I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony, "Oh!
Take him away!
I cannot see him; for God's sake, do not let him enter"!
Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.
He could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone, "I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance".
"My father"!
cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure.
"Is my father indeed come?
How kind, how very kind!
But where is he, why does he not hasten to me"?
My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium, and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence.
He rose and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.
Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father.
I stretched out my hand to him and cried, "Are you, then, safe--and Elizabeth--and Ernest"?
My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness.
"What a place is this that you inhabit, my son"!
said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room.
"You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you.
And poor Clerval--" The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.
"Alas!
Yes, my father," replied I; "some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry".
We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity.
Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.
But the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I gradually recovered my health.
As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate.
The image of Clerval was forever before me, ghastly and murdered.
More than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse.
Alas!
Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life?
It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a close.
Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest.
Then the appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.
The season of the assizes approached.
I had already been three months in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held.
Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.
I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death.
The grand jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight after my removal I was liberated from prison.
My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country.
I did not participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful.
The cup of life was poisoned forever, and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.
Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw them in my chamber at
My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection.
He talked of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me.
Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring maladie du pays, to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood; but my
At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.
Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair.
It was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his
My father still desired to delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a journey, for I was a shattered wreck--the shadow of a human being.
My strength was gone.
I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame.
Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience, my father thought it best to yield.
We took our passage on board a vessel bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.
It was midnight.
I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves.
I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva.
The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my
I repassed, in my memory, my whole life--my quiet happiness while residing with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt.
I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived.
I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.
Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life.
Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly.
But sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me.
Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the fiend's grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears.
My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the
Chapter 22 The voyage came to an end.
We landed, and proceeded to Paris.
I soon found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I could continue my journey.
My father's care and attentions were indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill.
He wished me to seek amusement in society.
I abhorred the face of man.
Oh, not abhorred!
They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism.
But I felt that I had no right to share their intercourse.
I had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans.
How they would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!
My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair.
Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.
"Alas!
My father," said I, "how little do you know me.
Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as I felt pride.
Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this--I murdered her.
William, Justine, and Henry--they all died by my hands".
My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium, and that, during my illness,
I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created.
I had a persuasion that I should be supposed mad, and this in itself would forever have chained my tongue.
But, besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast.
I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.
Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me.
I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.
Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, "My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this?
My dear son, I entreat you never to make such an assertion again".
"I am not mad," I cried energetically; "the sun and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.
I am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.
A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race".
The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts.
He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.
As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them.
By the utmost self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice.
A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the following letter from Elizabeth: "My dear Friend, "It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and
My poor cousin, how much you must have suffered!
I expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted Geneva.
This winter has been passed most miserably, tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity.
"Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.
I would not disturb you at this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet.
Explanation!
You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain?
If you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.
But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to express to
"You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy.
We were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place.
We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older.
But as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our case?
Tell me, dearest Victor.
Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth--Do you not love another?
"You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you might
But this is false reasoning.
I confess to you, my friend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion.
But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice.
Even now I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word 'honour,' all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself.
I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes.
Ah!
Victor, be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition.
Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.
"Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain.
My uncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness.
"Elizabeth Lavenza "Geneva, May 18th, 17--" This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend--"I WILL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING-NIGHT"!
Such was my sentence, and on that night would the daemon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings.
On that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death.
Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end.
If he were vanquished, I should be a free man.
Alas!
What freedom?
Such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, penniless, and alone, but free.
Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.
Sweet and beloved Elizabeth!
I read and reread her letter, and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel's arm bared to drive me from all hope.
Yet I would die to make her happy.
If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate.
My destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.
He had vowed TO BE WITH ME ON MY WEDDING-NIGHT, yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his
I resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father's happiness, my adversary's designs against my life should not retard it a single hour.
In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.
My letter was calm and affectionate.
"I fear, my beloved girl," I said, "little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in you.
Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment.
I have one secret, Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder that I survive what I have endured.
I will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place, for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.
But until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.
This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply".
In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth's letter we returned to Geneva.
The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks.
I saw a change in her also.
She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I was.
The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure.
Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent.
I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless, bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.
Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor.
She wept with me and for me.
When reason returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation.
Ah!
It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the guilty there is no peace.
The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.
Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with Elizabeth.
I remained silent.
"Have you, then, some other attachment"?
"None on earth.
I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight.
Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin".
"My dear Victor, do not speak thus.
Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live.
Our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.
And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived".
Such were the lessons of my father.
But to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words "I SHALL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR
But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as
Great God!
If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable
But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.
As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.
But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth.
She looked forward to our union with placid contentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and
Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received, and all wore a smiling appearance.
I shut up, as well as I could, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy.
Through my father's exertions a part of the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian government.
A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her.
It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood.
In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me.
I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.
Indeed, as the period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnization drew
Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind.
But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day.
My father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognized in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.
After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my father's, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day.
The day was fair, the wind favourable; all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.
Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the feeling of happiness.
We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Saleve, the pleasant banks of Montalegre, and at a distance,
I took the hand of Elizabeth.
"You are sorrowful, my love.
Ah!
If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy".
"Be happy, my dear Victor," replied Elizabeth; "there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented.
Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice.
Observe how fast we move along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting.
Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom.
What a divine day!
How happy and serene all nature appears"!
Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects.
But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie.
The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills.
The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.
The spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.
The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity, sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore, from which it wafted the most delightful
The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me forever.
Chapter 23 It was eight o'clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still
The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in the west.
The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the
Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.
I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind.
I was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was
Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, "What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?
What is it you fear"?
"Oh!
Peace, peace, my love," replied I; "this night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful".
I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the
She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary.
But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream.
It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.
As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs.
This state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room.
Great God!
Why did I not then expire!
Why am I here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth?
She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair.
Everywhere I turn I see the same figure--her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier.
Could I behold this and live?
Alas!
Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated.
For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.
When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me.
I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.
She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep.
I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.
The murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips.
While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.
The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.
The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.
A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife.
I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.
The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room.
I pointed to the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats; nets were cast, but in vain.
After passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy.
After having landed, they proceeded to search the country, parties going in different directions among the woods and vines.
I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat
In this state I was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that I had lost.
After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay.
There were women weeping around; I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause.
I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.
The death of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and
This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.
I started up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.
There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents.
However, it was hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night.
I hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise.
But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion.
I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose.
If I looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.
Tears streamed from my eyes.
The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth.
Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.
The sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before.
A fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.
But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event?
Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their acme, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you.
Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate.
My own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of my hideous narration.
I arrived at Geneva.
My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore.
I see him now, excellent and venerable old man!
His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight--his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to
Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness!
He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.
What then became of me?
I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.
Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon.
Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison.
For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.
Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.
As the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause--the monster whom I had created, the miserable daemon whom I had sent abroad into the world for my destruction.
I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head.
Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make,
The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness.
"Be assured, sir," said he, "no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain".
"I thank you," replied I; "listen, therefore, to the deposition that I have to make.
It is indeed a tale so strange that I should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which, however wonderful, forces conviction.
The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood".
My manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life.
I now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.
The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance.
When I had concluded my narration I said, "This is the being whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your whole power.
It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion".
This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor.
He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned.
He, however, answered mildly, "I would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance.
Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude?
Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit".
"I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey.
But I perceive your thoughts; you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert".
As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.
"You are mistaken," said he.
"I will exert myself, and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes.
But I fear, from what you have yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to disappointment".
"That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.
My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.
My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists.
You refuse my just demand; I have but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction".
I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.
But to a Genevan magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness.
He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.
"Man," I cried, "how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!
Cease; you know not what it is you say".
I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action.
Chapter 24 My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost.
I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion.
My first resolution was to quit Geneva forever; my country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful.
I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.
And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life.
I have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet.
How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death.
But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.
When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.
But my plan was unsettled, and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue.
As night approached I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed.
I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves.
Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer.
The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner.
The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair.
They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence.
I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, "By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside
For this purpose I will preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my eyes forever.
And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work.
Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me".
I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.
I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh.
It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.
Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance.
The laughter died away, when a well-known and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, "I am satisfied, miserable wretch!
You have determined to live, and I am satisfied".
I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp.
Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed.
I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.
Guided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly.
The blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.
I took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.
Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I have ever followed in his track.
Sometimes the peasants, scared by this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die, left some mark to guide me.
The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain.
To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel?
Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly extricate
Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me.
The fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me.
Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few drops that revived me, and vanish.
I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the daemon generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected.
In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path.
I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed, which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.
My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy.
O blessed sleep!
Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture.
The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage.
Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships.
During the day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth's voice, and beheld Clerval
Often, when wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends.
What agonizing fondness did I feel for them!
How did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived!
At such moments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the destruction of the daemon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the ardent desire
What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know.
Sometimes, indeed, he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury.
"My reign is not yet over"--these words were legible in one of these inscriptions--"you live, and my power is complete.
Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am impassive.
You will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed.
Come on, my enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive".
Scoffing devil!
Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee, miserable fiend, to torture and death.
Never will I give up my search until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!
As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support.
The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for prey.
The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.
The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours.
One inscription that he left was in these words: "Prepare!
Your toils only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred".
My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on heaven to support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and
Oh!
How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south!
Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness.
The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils.
I did not weep, but I knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary's gibe, to meet and grapple with him.
Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed.
I know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw the ocean he was but one day's journey in advance, and I hoped to
With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore.
I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information.
A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance.
He had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across
On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.
He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to
Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.
After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.
I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the frozen ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I departed from land.
I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support.
Immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.
But again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.
By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes.
Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.
Once, after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the
I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known form within.
Oh!
With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!
Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the daemon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud.
But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hour's rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route.
The sledge was still visible, nor did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags.
I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days' journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me.
But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had ever done before.
A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous and terrific.
I pressed on, but in vain.
The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound.
The work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death.
In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.
I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight.
I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship.
I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose.
I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue my enemy.
But your direction was northwards.
You took me on board when my vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.
Oh!
When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the daemon, allow me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live?
If I do, swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death.
And do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?
No; I am not so selfish.
Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he shall not live--swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes.
He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but trust him not.
His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and fiend-like malice.
Hear him not; call on the names of William, Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and thrust your sword into his heart.
I will hover near and direct the steel aright.
Walton, in continuation.
August 26th, 17-- You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?
Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish.
His fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness.
Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as
His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his
Such a monster has, then, really existence!
I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration.
Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature's formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.
"Are you mad, my friend"?
said he.
"Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you?
Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy?
Peace, peace!
Learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own".
Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy.
"Since you have preserved my narration," said he, "I would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity".
Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed.
My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created.
I wish to soothe him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live?
Oh, no!
The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death.
Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the
This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.
Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes.
On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension.
His eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love, without tears.
What a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin!
He seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.
"When younger," said he, "I believed myself destined for some great enterprise.
My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements.
This sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures.
When I reflected on the work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors.
But this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust.
All my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell.
My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man.
Even now I cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete.
I trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects.
From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk!
Oh!
My friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognize me in this state of degradation.
Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise".
Must I then lose this admirable being?
I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who would sympathize with and love me.
Behold, on these desert seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his value and lose him.
I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.
"I thank you, Walton," he said, "for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?
Can any man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth?
Even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain.
They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives.
A sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated with suspicion.
But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear.
They are dead, and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life.
If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.
But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die".
September 2nd My beloved Sister, I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit it.
I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel.
The brave fellows whom I have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have none to bestow.
There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me.
Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me.
If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.
And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind?
You will not hear of my destruction, and you will anxiously await my return.
Years will pass, and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope.
Oh!
My beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is, in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death.
But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy.
Heaven bless you and make you so!
My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion.
He endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued.
He reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries.
Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the resolutions of man.
These feelings are transitory; each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair.
September 5th A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it.
We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict.
The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation.
Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness.
I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.
This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend--his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly--I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin.
They entered, and their leader addressed me.
He told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.
We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers, after they might
They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southwards.
This speech troubled me.
I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free.
Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?
I hesitated before I answered, when Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled, and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour.
Turning towards the men, he said, "What do you mean?
What do you demand of your captain?
Are you, then, so easily turned from your design?
Did you not call this a glorious expedition?
"And wherefore was it glorious?
Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these
For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking.
You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind.
And now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls,
Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards.
Oh!
Be men, or be more than men.
Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock.
This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not.
Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows.
Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe".
He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved?
They looked at one another and were unable to reply.
I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage would return.
They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life.
How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled.
Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships.
September 7th The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.
Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed.
It requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this injustice with patience.
September 12th It is past; I am returning to England.
I have lost my hopes of utility and glory; I have lost my friend.
But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted towards England and towards you, I will not despond.
September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction.
We were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed.
The ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free.
When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them, loud and long-continued.
Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult.
"They shout," I said, "because they will soon return to England".
"Do you, then, really return"?
"Alas!
Yes; I cannot withstand their demands.
I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and I must return".
"Do so, if you will; but I will not.
You may give up your purpose, but mine is assigned to me by heaven, and I dare not.
I am weak, but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength".
Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.
It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was entirely extinct.
At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak.
The surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed.
In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.
His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient.
I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said, "Alas!
The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being.
Think not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary.
During these last days I have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.
In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being.
"This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that.
My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery.
Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature.
He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end.
Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die.
The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed.
When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue.
"Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of meeting with him.
But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death.
I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion.
"That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years.
The forms of the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms.
Farewell, Walton!
Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries.
Yet why do I say this?
I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed".
His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his effort, he sank into silence.
About half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and his eyes closed forever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips.
Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit?
What can I say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow?
All that I should express would be inadequate and feeble.
My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment.
But I journey towards England, and I may there find consolation.
I am interrupted.
What do these sounds portend?
It is midnight; the breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir.
Again there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie.
I must arise and examine.
Good night, my sister.
Great God!
what a scene has just taken place!
I am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it.
I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe.
I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable friend.
Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe--gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions.
As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy.
When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window.
Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness.
I shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.
I called on him to stay.
He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion.
"That is also my victim"!
he exclaimed.
"In his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close!
Oh, Frankenstein!
Generous and self-devoted being!
What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me?
I, who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst.
Alas!
He is cold, he cannot answer me".
His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion.
I approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness.
I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips.
The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches.
At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.
"Your repentance," I said, "is now superfluous.
If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived".
"And do you dream"?
said the daemon.
"Do you think that I was then dead to agony and remorse?
He," he continued, pointing to the corpse, "he suffered not in the consummation of the deed.
Oh!
Not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution.
A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse.
Think you that the groans of Clerval were music to my ears?
My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine.
"After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken and overcome.
I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I abhorred myself.
But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the
I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.
I knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not disobey.
Yet when she died!
Nay, then I was not miserable.
I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my despair.
Evil thenceforth became my good.
Urged thus far, I had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen.
The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion.
And now it is ended; there is my last victim"!
I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me.
"Wretch"!
I said.
"It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made.
You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall.
Hypocritical fiend!
If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance.
It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power".
"Oh, it is not thus--not thus," interrupted the being.
"Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions.
Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.
No sympathy may I ever find.
When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed, that I wished to be participated.
But now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?
I am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory.
Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment.
Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.
I was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion.
But now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal.
No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine.
When I run over the frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness.
But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil.
Yet even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.
"You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes.
But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions.
For while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own desires.
They were forever ardent and craving; still I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.
Was there no injustice in this?
Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me?
Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely?
Why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child?
Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings!
I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on.
Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.
"But it is true that I am a wretch.
I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.
I have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin.
"There he lies, white and cold in death.
You hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself.
I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.
"Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief.
My work is nearly complete.
Neither yours nor any man's death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own.
Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice.
I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and
I shall die.
I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched.
He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish.
I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks.
"Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my happiness.
Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my
Polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?
"Farewell!
I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold.
Farewell, Frankenstein!
If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction.
But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel.
Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them forever.
"But soon," he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, "I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt.
Soon these burning miseries will be extinct.
I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames.
The light of that conflagration will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds.
My spirit will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.
Farewell".
He sprang from the cabin window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel.
He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.The Last Man Mary W. Shelley First edition.

I. INTRODUCTION.
I VISITED Naples in the year 1818.
On the 8th of December of that year, my companion and I crossed the Bay, to visit the antiquities which are scattered on the shores of Baiae.
The translucent and shining waters of the calm sea covered fragments of old Roman villas, which were interlaced by sea-weed, and received diamond tints from the chequering of the sun-beams; the blue and pellucid element was such as Galatea might have
Though it was winter, the atmosphere seemed more appropriate to early spring; and its genial warmth contributed to inspire those sensations of placid delight, which are the portion of every traveller, as he lingers, loath to quit the tranquil bays and
We visited the so called Elysian Fields and Avernus: and wandered through various ruined temples, baths, and classic spots; at length we entered the gloomy cavern of the Cumaean Sibyl.
Our Lazzeroni bore flaring torches, which shone red, and almost dusky, in the murky subterranean passages, whose darkness thirstily surrounding them, seemed eager to imbibe more and more of the element of light.
We passed by a natural archway, leading to a second gallery, and enquired, if we could not enter there also.
The guides pointed to the reflection of their torches on the water that paved it, leaving us to form our own conclusion; but adding it was a pity, for it led to the Sibyl's Cave.
Our curiosity and enthusiasm were excited by this circumstance, and we insisted upon attempting the passage.
As is usually the case in the prosecution of such enterprizes, the difficulties decreased on examination.
We found, on each side of the humid pathway, "dry land for the sole of the foot".
At length we arrived at a large, desert, dark cavern, which the Lazzeroni assured us was the Sibyl's Cave.
We were sufficiently disappointed--Yet we examined it with care, as if its blank, rocky walls could still bear trace of celestial visitant.
On one side was a small opening.
Whither does this lead?
we asked: can we enter here?
--"Questo poi, no,"--said the wild looking savage, who held the torch; "you can advance but a short distance, and nobody visits it".
"Nevertheless, I will try it," said my companion; "it may lead to the real cavern.
Shall I go alone, or will you accompany me"?
I signified my readiness to proceed, but our guides protested against such a measure.
With great volubility, in their native Neapolitan dialect, with which we were not very familiar, they told us that there were spectres, that the roof would fall in, that it was too narrow to admit us, that there was a deep hole within, filled with water,
My friend shortened the harangue, by taking the man's torch from him; and we proceeded alone.
The passage, which at first scarcely admitted us, quickly grew narrower and lower; we were almost bent double; yet still we persisted in making our way through it.
At length we entered a wider space, and the low roof heightened; but, as we congratulated ourselves on this change, our torch was extinguished by a current of air, and we were left in utter darkness.
The guides bring with them materials for renewing the light, but we had none--our only resource was to return as we came.
We groped round the widened space to find the entrance, and after a time fancied that we had succeeded.
This proved however to be a second passage, which evidently ascended.
It terminated like the former; though something approaching to a ray, we could not tell whence, shed a very doubtful twilight in the space.
By degrees, our eyes grew somewhat accustomed to this dimness, and we perceived that there was no direct passage leading us further; but that it was possible to climb one side of the cavern to a low arch at top, which promised a more easy path, from whence
With considerable difficulty we scrambled up, and came to another passage with still more of illumination, and this led to another ascent like the former.
After a succession of these, which our resolution alone permitted us to surmount, we arrived at a wide cavern with an arched dome-like roof.
An aperture in the midst let in the light of heaven; but this was overgrown with brambles and underwood, which acted as a veil, obscuring the day, and giving a solemn religious hue to the apartment.
It was spacious, and nearly circular, with a raised seat of stone, about the size of a Grecian couch, at one end.
The only sign that life had been here, was the perfect snow-white skeleton of a goat, which had probably not perceived the opening as it grazed on the hill above, and had fallen headlong.
Ages perhaps had elapsed since this catastrophe; and the ruin it had made above, had been repaired by the growth of vegetation during many hundred summers.
The rest of the furniture of the cavern consisted of piles of leaves, fragments of bark, and a white filmy substance, resembling the inner part of the green hood which shelters the grain of the unripe Indian corn.
We were fatigued by our struggles to attain this point, and seated ourselves on the rocky couch, while the sounds of tinkling sheep-bells, and shout of shepherd-boy, reached us from above.
At length my friend, who had taken up some of the leaves strewed about, exclaimed, "This is the Sibyl's cave; these are Sibylline leaves".
On examination, we found that all the leaves, bark, and other substances, were traced with written characters.
What appeared to us more astonishing, was that these writings were expressed in various languages: some unknown to my companion, ancient Chaldee, and Egyptian hieroglyphics, old as the Pyramids.
Stranger still, some were in modern dialects, English and Italian.
We could make out little by the dim light, but they seemed to contain prophecies, detailed relations of events but lately passed; names, now well known, but of modern date; and often exclamations of exultation or woe, of victory or defeat, were traced on
This was certainly the Sibyl's Cave; not indeed exactly as Virgil describes it, but the whole of this land had been so convulsed by earthquake and volcano, that the change was not wonderful, though the traces of ruin were effaced by time; and we probably
We made a hasty selection of such of the leaves, whose writing one at least of us could understand; and then, laden with our treasure, we bade adieu to the dim hypaethric cavern, and after much difficulty succeeded in rejoining our guides.
During our stay at Naples, we often returned to this cave, sometimes alone, skimming the sun-lit sea, and each time added to our store.
Since that period, whenever the world's circumstance has not imperiously called me away, or the temper of my mind impeded such study, I have been employed in deciphering these sacred remains.
Their meaning, wondrous and eloquent, has often repaid my toil, soothing me in sorrow, and exciting my imagination to daring flights, through the immensity of nature and the mind of man.
For awhile my labours were not solitary; but that time is gone; and, with the selected and matchless companion of my toils, their dearest reward is also lost to me-- Di mie tenere frondi altro lavoro Credea mostrarte; e qual fero pianeta Ne' nvidio
I present the public with my latest discoveries in the slight Sibylline pages.
Scattered and unconnected as they were, I have been obliged to add links, and model the work into a consistent form.
But the main substance rests on the truths contained in these poetic rhapsodies, and the divine intuition which the Cumaean damsel obtained from heaven.
I have often wondered at the subject of her verses, and at the English dress of the Latin poet.
Sometimes I have thought, that, obscure and chaotic as they are, they owe their present form to me, their decipherer.
As if we should give to another artist, the painted fragments which form the mosaic copy of Raphael's Transfiguration in St. Peter's; he would put them together in a form, whose mode would be fashioned by his own peculiar mind and talent.
Doubtless the leaves of the Cumaean Sibyl have suffered distortion and diminution of interest and excellence in my hands.
My only excuse for thus transforming them, is that they were unintelligible in their pristine condition.
My labours have cheered long hours of solitude, and taken me out of a world, which has averted its once benignant face from me, to one glowing with imagination and power.
Will my readers ask how I could find solace from the narration of misery and woeful change?
This is one of the mysteries of our nature, which holds full sway over me, and from whose influence I cannot escape.
I confess, that I have not been unmoved by the development of the tale; and that I have been depressed, nay, agonized, at some parts of the recital, which I have faithfully transcribed from my materials.
Yet such is human nature, that the excitement of mind was dear to me, and that the imagination, painter of tempest and earthquake, or, worse, the stormy and ruin-fraught passions of man, softened my real sorrows and endless regrets, by clothing these
I hardly know whether this apology is necessary.
For the merits of my adaptation and translation must decide how far I have well bestowed my time and imperfect powers, in giving form and substance to the frail and attenuated Leaves of the Sibyl.
CHAPTER I. I AM the native of a sea-surrounded nook, a cloud-enshadowed land, which, when the surface of the globe, with its shoreless ocean and trackless continents, presents itself to my mind, appears only as an inconsiderable speck in the immense whole;
So true it is, that man's mind alone was the creator of all that was good or great to man, and that Nature herself was only his first minister.
England, seated far north in the turbid sea, now visits my dreams in the semblance of a vast and well-manned ship, which mastered the winds and rode proudly over the waves.
In my boyish days she was the universe to me.
When I stood on my native hills, and saw plain and mountain stretch out to the utmost limits of my vision, speckled by the dwellings of my countrymen, and subdued to fertility by their labours, the earth's very centre was fixed for me in that spot, and the
My fortunes have been, from the beginning, an exemplification of the power that mutability may possess over the varied tenor of man's life.
With regard to myself, this came almost by inheritance.
My father was one of those men on whom nature had bestowed to prodigality the envied gifts of wit and imagination, and then left his bark of life to be impelled by these winds, without adding reason as the rudder, or judgment as the pilot for the voyage.
His extraction was obscure; but circumstances brought him early into public notice, and his small paternal property was soon dissipated in the splendid scene of fashion and luxury in which he was an actor.
During the short years of thoughtless youth, he was adored by the high-bred triflers of the day, nor least by the youthful sovereign, who escaped from the intrigues of party, and the arduous duties of kingly business, to find never-failing amusement and
My father's impulses, never under his own controul, perpetually led him into difficulties from which his ingenuity alone could extricate him; and the accumulating pile of debts of honour and of trade, which would have bent to earth any other, was supported
This kind of popularity, like every other, is evanescent: and the difficulties of every kind with which he had to contend, increased in a frightful ratio compared with his small means of extricating himself.
At such times the king, in his enthusiasm for him, would come to his relief, and then kindly take his friend to task; my father gave the best promises for amendment, but his social disposition, his craving for the usual diet of admiration, and more than
With the quick sensibility peculiar to his temperament, he perceived his power in the brilliant circle to be on the wane.
The king married; and the haughty princess of Austria, who became, as queen of England, the head of fashion, looked with harsh eyes on his defects, and with contempt on the affection her royal husband entertained for him.
My father felt that his fall was near; but so far from profiting by this last calm before the storm to save himself, he sought to forget anticipated evil by making still greater sacrifices to the deity of pleasure, deceitful and cruel arbiter of his
The king, who was a man of excellent dispositions, but easily led, had now become a willing disciple of his imperious consort.
He was induced to look with extreme disapprobation, and at last with distaste, on my father's imprudence and follies.
It is true that his presence dissipated these clouds; his warm-hearted frankness, brilliant sallies, and confiding demeanour were irresistible: it was only when at a distance, while still renewed tales of his errors were poured into his royal friend's ear,
The queen's dextrous management was employed to prolong these absences, and gather together accusations.
At length the king was brought to see in him a source of perpetual disquiet, knowing that he should pay for the short-lived pleasure of his society by tedious homilies, and more painful narrations of excesses, the truth of which he could not disprove.
The result was, that he would make one more attempt to reclaim him, and in case of ill success, cast him off for ever.
Such a scene must have been one of deepest interest and high-wrought passion.
A powerful king, conspicuous for a goodness which had heretofore made him meek, and now lofty in his admonitions, with alternate entreaty and reproof, besought his friend to attend to his real interests, resolutely to avoid those fascinations which in fact
My father felt this kindness; for a moment ambitious dreams floated before him; and he thought that it would be well to exchange his present pursuits for nobler duties.
With sincerity and fervour he gave the required promise: as a pledge of continued favour, he received from his royal master a sum of money to defray pressing debts, and enable him to enter under good auspices his new career.
That very night, while yet full of gratitude and good resolves, this whole sum, and its amount doubled, was lost at the gaming-table.
In his desire to repair his first losses, my father risked double stakes, and thus incurred a debt of honour he was wholly unable to pay.
Ashamed to apply again to the king, he turned his back upon London, its false delights and clinging miseries; and, with poverty for his sole companion, buried himself in solitude among the hills and lakes of Cumberland.
His wit, his bon mots, the record of his personal attractions, fascinating manners, and social talents, were long remembered and repeated from mouth to mouth.
Ask where now was this favourite of fashion, this companion of the noble, this excelling beam, which gilt with alien splendour the assemblies of the courtly and the gay--you heard that he was under a cloud, a lost man; not one thought it belonged to him to
The king lamented his absence; he loved to repeat his sayings, relate the adventures they had had together, and exalt his talents--but here ended his reminiscence.
Meanwhile my father, forgotten, could not forget.
He repined for the loss of what was more necessary to him than air or food--the excitements of pleasure, the admiration of the noble, the luxurious and polished living of the great.
A nervous fever was the consequence; during which he was nursed by the daughter of a poor cottager, under whose roof he lodged.
She was lovely, gentle, and, above all, kind to him; nor can it afford astonishment, that the late idol of high-bred beauty should, even in a fallen state, appear a being of an elevated and wondrous nature to the lowly cottage-girl.
The attachment between them led to the ill-fated marriage, of which I was the offspring.
Notwithstanding the tenderness and sweetness of my mother, her husband still deplored his degraded state.
Unaccustomed to industry, he knew not in what way to contribute to the support of his increasing family.
Sometimes he thought of applying to the king; pride and shame for a while withheld him; and, before his necessities became so imperious as to compel him to some kind of exertion, he died.
For one brief interval before this catastrophe, he looked forward to the future, and contemplated with anguish the desolate situation in which his wife and children would be left.
His last effort was a letter to the king, full of touching eloquence, and of occasional flashes of that brilliant spirit which was an integral part of him.
He bequeathed his widow and orphans to the friendship of his royal master, and felt satisfied that, by this means, their prosperity was better assured in his death than in his life.
This letter was enclosed to the care of a nobleman, who, he did not doubt, would perform the last and inexpensive office of placing it in the king's own hand.
He died in debt, and his little property was seized immediately by his creditors.
My mother, pennyless and burthened with two children, waited week after week, and month after month, in sickening expectation of a reply, which never came.
She had no experience beyond her father's cottage; and the mansion of the lord of the manor was the chiefest type of grandeur she could conceive.
During my father's life, she had been made familiar with the name of royalty and the courtly circle; but such things, ill according with her personal experience, appeared, after the loss of him who gave substance and reality to them, vague and fantastical.
If, under any circumstances, she could have acquired sufficient courage to address the noble persons mentioned by her husband, the ill success of his own application caused her to banish the idea.
She saw therefore no escape from dire penury: perpetual care, joined to sorrow for the loss of the wondrous being, whom she continued to contemplate with ardent admiration, hard labour, and naturally delicate health, at length released her from the sad
The condition of her orphan children was peculiarly desolate.
Her own father had been an emigrant from another part of the country, and had died long since: they had no one relation to take them by the hand; they were outcasts, paupers, unfriended beings, to whom the most scanty pittance was a matter of favour, and
I, the elder of the two, was five years old when my mother died.
A remembrance of the discourses of my parents, and the communications which my mother endeavoured to impress upon me concerning my father's friends, in slight hope that I might one day derive benefit from the knowledge, floated like an indistinct dream
I conceived that I was different and superior to my protectors and companions, but I knew not how or wherefore.
The sense of injury, associated with the name of king and noble, clung to me; but I could draw no conclusions from such feelings, to serve as a guide to action.
My first real knowledge of myself was as an unprotected orphan among the valleys and fells of Cumberland.
I was in the service of a farmer; and with crook in hand, my dog at my side, I shepherded a numerous flock on the near uplands.
I cannot say much in praise of such a life; and its pains far exceeded its pleasures.
There was freedom in it, a companionship with nature, and a reckless loneliness; but these, romantic as they were, did not accord with the love of action and desire of human sympathy, characteristic of youth.
Neither the care of my flock, nor the change of seasons, were sufficient to tame my eager spirit; my out-door life and unemployed time were the temptations that led me early into lawless habits.
I associated with others friendless like myself; I formed them into a band, I was their chief and captain.
All shepherd-boys alike, while our flocks were spread over the pastures, we schemed and executed many a mischievous prank, which drew on us the anger and revenge of the rustics.
I was the leader and protector of my comrades, and as I became distinguished among them, their misdeeds were usually visited upon me.
But while I endured punishment and pain in their defence with the spirit of an hero, I claimed as my reward their praise and obedience.
In such a school my disposition became rugged, but firm.
The appetite for admiration and small capacity for self-controul which I inherited from my father, nursed by adversity, made me daring and reckless.
I was rough as the elements, and unlearned as the animals I tended.
I often compared myself to them, and finding that my chief superiority consisted in power, I soon persuaded myself that it was in power only that I was inferior to the chiefest potentates of the earth.
Thus untaught in refined philosophy, and pursued by a restless feeling of degradation from my true station in society, I wandered among the hills of civilized England as uncouth a savage as the wolf-bred founder of old Rome.
I owned but one law, it was that of the strongest, and my greatest deed of virtue was never to submit.
Yet let me a little retract from this sentence I have passed on myself.
My mother, when dying, had, in addition to her other half-forgotten and misapplied lessons, committed, with solemn exhortation, her other child to my fraternal guardianship; and this one duty I performed to the best of my ability, with all the zeal and
My sister was three years younger than myself; I had nursed her as an infant, and when the difference of our sexes, by giving us various occupations, in a great measure divided us, yet she continued to be the object of my careful love.
Orphans, in the fullest sense of the term, we were poorest among the poor, and despised among the unhonoured.
If my daring and courage obtained for me a kind of respectful aversion, her youth and sex, since they did not excite tenderness, by proving her to be weak, were the causes of numberless mortifications to her; and her own disposition was not so constituted
She was a singular being, and, like me, inherited much of the peculiar disposition of our father.
Her countenance was all expression; her eyes were not dark, but impenetrably deep; you seemed to discover space after space in their intellectual glance, and to feel that the soul which was their soul, comprehended an universe of thought in its ken.
She was pale and fair, and her golden hair clustered on her temples, contrasting its rich hue with the living marble beneath.
Her coarse peasant-dress, little consonant apparently with the refinement of feeling which her face expressed, yet in a strange manner accorded with it.
She was like one of Guido's saints, with heaven in her heart and in her look, so that when you saw her you only thought of that within, and costume and even feature were secondary to the mind that beamed in her countenance.
Yet though lovely and full of noble feeling, my poor Perdita (for this was the fanciful name my sister had received from her dying parent), was not altogether saintly in her disposition.
Her manners were cold and repulsive.
If she had been nurtured by those who had regarded her with affection, she might have been different; but unloved and neglected, she repaid want of kindness with distrust and silence.
She was submissive to those who held authority over her, but a perpetual cloud dwelt on her brow; she looked as if she expected enmity from every one who approached her, and her actions were instigated by the same feeling.
All the time she could command she spent in solitude.
She would ramble to the most unfrequented places, and scale dangerous heights, that in those unvisited spots she might wrap herself in loneliness.
Often she passed whole hours walking up and down the paths of the woods; she wove garlands of flowers and ivy, or watched the flickering of the shadows and glancing of the leaves; sometimes she sat beside a stream, and as her thoughts paused, threw flowers
Meanwhile her active fancy wove a thousand combinations; she dreamt "of moving accidents by flood and field"--she lost herself delightedly in these self-created wanderings, and returned with unwilling spirit to the dull detail of common life.
Poverty was the cloud that veiled her excellencies, and all that was good in her seemed about to perish from want of the genial dew of affection.
She had not even the same advantage as I in the recollection of her parents; she clung to me, her brother, as her only friend, but her alliance with me completed the distaste that her protectors felt for her; and every error was magnified by them into
If she had been bred in that sphere of life to which by inheritance the delicate framework of her mind and person was adapted, she would have been the object almost of adoration, for her virtues were as eminent as her defects.
All the genius that ennobled the blood of her father illustrated hers; a generous tide flowed in her veins; artifice, envy, or meanness, were at the antipodes of her nature; her countenance, when enlightened by amiable feeling, might have belonged to a
Although by our situation and dispositions we were almost equally cut off from the usual forms of social intercourse, we formed a strong contrast to each other.
I always required the stimulants of companionship and applause.
Perdita was all-sufficient to herself.
Notwithstanding my lawless habits, my disposition was sociable, hers recluse.
My life was spent among tangible realities, hers was a dream.
I might be said even to love my enemies, since by exciting me they in a sort bestowed happiness upon me; Perdita almost disliked her friends, for they interfered with her visionary moods.
All my feelings, even of exultation and triumph, were changed to bitterness, if unparticipated; Perdita, even in joy, fled to loneliness, and could go on from day to day, neither expressing her emotions, nor seeking a fellow-feeling in another mind.
Nay, she could love and dwell with tenderness on the look and voice of her friend, while her demeanour expressed the coldest reserve.
A sensation with her became a sentiment, and she never spoke until she had mingled her perceptions of outward objects with others which were the native growth of her own mind.
She was like a fruitful soil that imbibed the airs and dews of heaven, and gave them forth again to light in loveliest forms of fruits and flowers; but then she was often dark and rugged as that soil, raked up, and new sown with unseen seed.
She dwelt in a cottage whose trim grass-plat sloped down to the waters of the lake of Ulswater; a beech wood stretched up the hill behind, and a purling brook gently falling from the acclivity ran through poplar-shaded banks into the lake.
I lived with a farmer whose house was built higher up among the hills: a dark crag rose behind it, and, exposed to the north, the snow lay in its crevices the summer through.
Before dawn I led my flock to the sheep-walks, and guarded them through the day.
It was a life of toil; for rain and cold were more frequent than sunshine; but it was my pride to contemn the elements.
My trusty dog watched the sheep as I slipped away to the rendezvous of my comrades, and thence to the accomplishment of our schemes.
At noon we met again, and we threw away in contempt our peasant fare, as we built our fire-place and kindled the cheering blaze destined to cook the game stolen from the neighbouring preserves.
Then came the tale of hair-breadth escapes, combats with dogs, ambush and flight, as gipsey-like we encompassed our pot.
The search after a stray lamb, or the devices by which we elude or endeavoured to elude punishment, filled up the hours of afternoon; in the evening my flock went to its fold, and I to my sister.
It was seldom indeed that we escaped, to use an old-fashioned phrase, scot free.
Our dainty fare was often exchanged for blows and imprisonment.
Once, when thirteen years of age, I was sent for a month to the county jail.
I came out, my morals unimproved, my hatred to my oppressors encreased tenfold.
Bread and water did not tame my blood, nor solitary confinement inspire me with gentle thoughts.
I was angry, impatient, miserable; my only happy hours were those during which I devised schemes of revenge; these were perfected in my forced solitude, so that during the whole of the following season, and I was freed early in September, I never failed to
This was a glorious winter.
The sharp frost and heavy snows tamed the animals, and kept the country gentlemen by their firesides; we got more game than we could eat, and my faithful dog grew sleek upon our refuse.
Thus years passed on; and years only added fresh love of freedom, and contempt for all that was not as wild and rude as myself.
At the age of sixteen I had shot up in appearance to man's estate; I was tall and athletic; I was practised to feats of strength, and inured to the inclemency of the elements.
My skin was embrowned by the sun; my step was firm with conscious power.
I feared no man, and loved none.
In after life I looked back with wonder to what I then was; how utterly worthless I should have become if I had pursued my lawless career.
My life was like that of an animal, and my mind was in danger of degenerating into that which informs brute nature.
Until now, my savage habits had done me no radical mischief; my physical powers had grown up and flourished under their influence, and my mind, undergoing the same discipline, was imbued with all the hardy virtues.
But now my boasted independence was daily instigating me to acts of tyranny, and freedom was becoming licentiousness.
I stood on the brink of manhood; passions, strong as the trees of a forest, had already taken root within me, and were about to shadow with their noxious overgrowth, my path of life.
I panted for enterprises beyond my childish exploits, and formed distempered dreams of future action.
I avoided my ancient comrades, and I soon lost them.
They arrived at the age when they were sent to fulfil their destined situations in life; while I, an outcast, with none to lead or drive me forward, paused.
The old began to point at me as an example, the young to wonder at me as a being distinct from themselves; I hated them, and began, last and worst degradation, to hate myself.
I clung to my ferocious habits, yet half despised them; I continued my war against civilization, and yet entertained a wish to belong to it.
I revolved again and again all that I remembered my mother to have told me of my father's former life; I contemplated the few relics I possessed belonging to him, which spoke of greater refinement than could be found among the mountain cottages; but
My father had been connected with nobles, but all I knew of such connection was subsequent neglect.
The name of the king,--he to whom my dying father had addressed his latest prayers, and who had barbarously slighted them, was associated only with the ideas of unkindness, injustice, and consequent resentment.
I was born for something greater than I was--and greater I would become; but greatness, at least to my distorted perceptions, was no necessary associate of goodness, and my wild thoughts were unchecked by moral considerations when they rioted in dreams of
Thus I stood upon a pinnacle, a sea of evil rolled at my feet; I was about to precipitate myself into it, and rush like a torrent over all obstructions to the object of my wishes-- when a stranger influence came over the current of my fortunes, and changed
CHAPTER II.
I LIVED far from the busy haunts of men, and the rumour of wars or political changes came worn to a mere sound, to our mountain abodes.
England had been the scene of momentous struggles, during my early boyhood.
In the year 2073, the last of its kings, the ancient friend of my father, had abdicated in compliance with the gentle force of the remonstrances of his subjects, and a republic was instituted.
Large estates were secured to the dethroned monarch and his family; he received the title of Earl of Windsor, and Windsor Castle, an ancient royalty, with its wide demesnes were a part of his allotted wealth.
He died soon after, leaving two children, a son and a daughter.
The ex-queen, a princess of the house of Austria, had long impelled her husband to withstand the necessity of the times.
She was haughty and fearless; she cherished a love of power, and a bitter contempt for him who had despoiled himself of a kingdom.
For her children's sake alone she consented to remain, shorn of regality, a member of the English republic.
When she became a widow, she turned all her thoughts to the educating her son Adrian, second Earl of Windsor, so as to accomplish her ambitious ends; and with his mother's milk he imbibed, and was intended to grow up in the steady purpose of re-acquiring
Adrian was now fifteen years of age.
He was addicted to study, and imbued beyond his years with learning and talent: report said that he had already begun to thwart his mother's views, and to entertain republican principles.
However this might be, the haughty Countess entrusted none with the secrets of her family-tuition.
Adrian was bred up in solitude, and kept apart from the natural companions of his age and rank.
Some unknown circumstance now induced his mother to send him from under her immediate tutelage; and we heard that he was about to visit Cumberland.
A thousand tales were rife, explanatory of the Countess of Windsor's conduct; none true probably; but each day it became more certain that we should have the noble scion of the late regal house of England among us.
There was a large estate with a mansion attached to it, belonging to this family, at Ulswater.
A large park was one of its appendages, laid out with great taste, and plentifully stocked with game.
I had often made depredations on these preserves; and the neglected state of the property facilitated my incursions.
When it was decided that the young Earl of Windsor should visit Cumberland, workmen arrived to put the house and grounds in order for his reception.
The apartments were restored to their pristine splendour, and the park, all disrepairs restored, was guarded with unusual care.
I was beyond measure disturbed by this intelligence.
It roused all my dormant recollections, my suspended sentiments of injury, and gave rise to the new one of revenge.
I could no longer attend to my occupations; all my plans and devices were forgotten; I seemed about to begin life anew, and that under no good auspices.
The tug of war, I thought, was now to begin.
He would come triumphantly to the district to which my parent had fled broken-hearted; he would find the ill-fated offspring, bequeathed with such vain confidence to his royal father, miserable paupers.
That he should know of our existence, and treat us, near at hand, with the same contumely which his father had practised in distance and absence, appeared to me the certain consequence of all that had gone before.
Thus then I should meet this titled stripling--the son of my father's friend.
He would be hedged in by servants; nobles, and the sons of nobles, were his companions; all England rang with his name; and his coming, like a thunderstorm, was heard from far: while I, unlettered and unfashioned, should, if I came in contact with him, in
With my mind fully occupied by these ideas, I might be said as if fascinated, to haunt the destined abode of the young Earl.
I watched the progress of the improvements, and stood by the unlading waggons, as various articles of luxury, brought from London, were taken forth and conveyed into the mansion.
It was part of the Ex-Queen's plan, to surround her son with princely magnificence.
I beheld rich carpets and silken hangings, ornaments of gold, richly embossed metals, emblazoned furniture, and all the appendages of high rank arranged, so that nothing but what was regal in splendour should reach the eye of one of royal descent.
I looked on these; I turned my gaze to my own mean dress.
--Whence sprung this difference?
Whence but from ingratitude, from falsehood, from a dereliction on the part of the prince's father, of all noble sympathy and generous feeling.
Doubtless, he also, whose blood received a mingling tide from his proud mother--he, the acknowledged focus of the kingdom's wealth and nobility, had been taught to repeat my father's name with disdain, and to scoff at my just claims to protection.
I strove to think that all this grandeur was but more glaring infamy, and that, by planting his gold-enwoven flag beside my tarnished and tattered banner, he proclaimed not his superiority, but his debasement.
Yet I envied him.
His stud of beautiful horses, his arms of costly workmanship, the praise that attended him, the adoration, ready servitor, high place and high esteem,--I considered them as forcibly wrenched from me, and envied them all with novel and tormenting
To crown my vexation of spirit, Perdita, the visionary Perdita, seemed to awake to real life with transport, when she told me that the Earl of Windsor was about to arrive.
"And this pleases you"?
I observed, moodily.
"Indeed it does, Lionel," she replied; "I quite long to see him; he is the descendant of our kings, the first noble of the land: every one admires and loves him, and they say that his rank is his least merit; he is generous, brave, and affable".
"You have learnt a pretty lesson, Perdita," said I, "and repeat it so literally, that you forget the while the proofs we have of the Earl's virtues; his generosity to us is manifest in our plenty, his bravery in the protection he affords us, his affability
His rank his least merit, do you say?
Why, all his virtues are derived from his station only; because he is rich, he is called generous; because he is powerful, brave; because he is well served, he is affable.
Let them call him so, let all England believe him to be thus--we know him--he is our enemy--our penurious, dastardly, arrogant enemy; if he were gifted with one particle of the virtues you call his, he would do justly by us, if it were only to shew, that
His father injured my father--his father, unassailable on his throne, dared despise him who only stooped beneath himself, when he deigned to associate with the royal ingrate.
We, descendants from the one and the other, must be enemies also.
He shall find that I can feel my injuries; he shall learn to dread my revenge"!
A few days after he arrived.
Every inhabitant of the most miserable cottage, went to swell the stream of population that poured forth to meet him: even Perdita, in spite of my late philippic, crept near the highway, to behold this idol of all hearts.
I, driven half mad, as I met party after party of the country people, in their holiday best, descending the hills, escaped to their cloud-veiled summits, and looking on the sterile rocks about me, exclaimed--"They do not cry, long live the Earl"!
Nor, when night came, accompanied by drizzling rain and cold, would I return home; for I knew that each cottage rang with the praises of Adrian; as I felt my limbs grow numb and chill, my pain served as food for my insane aversion; nay, I almost triumphed
All was attributed to him, for I confounded so entirely the idea of father and son, that I forgot that the latter might be wholly unconscious of his parent's neglect of us; and as I struck my aching head with my hand, I cried: "He shall hear of this!
I will be revenged!
I will not suffer like a spaniel!
He shall know, beggar and friendless as I am, that I will not tamely submit to injury"!
Each day, each hour added to these exaggerated wrongs.
His praises were so many adder's stings infixed in my vulnerable breast.
If I saw him at a distance, riding a beautiful horse, my blood boiled with rage; the air seemed poisoned by his presence, and my very native English was changed to a vile jargon, since every phrase I heard was coupled with his name and honour.
I panted to relieve this painful heart-burning by some misdeed that should rouse him to a sense of my antipathy.
It was the height of his offending, that he should occasion in me such intolerable sensations, and not deign himself to afford any demonstration that he was aware that I even lived to feel them.
It soon became known that Adrian took great delight in his park and preserves.
He never sported, but spent hours in watching the tribes of lovely and almost tame animals with which it was stocked, and ordered that greater care should be taken of them than ever.
Here was an opening for my plans of offence, and I made use of it with all the brute impetuosity I derived from my active mode of life.
I proposed the enterprize of poaching on his demesne to my few remaining comrades, who were the most determined and lawless of the crew; but they all shrunk from the peril; so I was left to achieve my revenge myself.
At first my exploits were unperceived; I increased in daring; footsteps on the dewy grass, torn boughs, and marks of slaughter, at length betrayed me to the game-keepers.
They kept better watch; I was taken, and sent to prison.
I entered its gloomy walls in a fit of triumphant extasy: "He feels me now," I cried, "and shall, again and again"!
--I passed but one day in confinement; in the evening I was liberated, as I was told, by the order of the Earl himself.
This news precipitated me from my self-raised pinnacle of honour.
He despises me, I thought; but he shall learn that I despise him, and hold in equal contempt his punishments and his clemency.
On the second night after my release, I was again taken by the gamekeepers--again imprisoned, and again released; and again, such was my pertinacity, did the fourth night find me in the forbidden park.
The gamekeepers were more enraged than their lord by my obstinacy.
They had received orders that if I were again taken, I should be brought to the Earl; and his lenity made them expect a conclusion which they considered ill befitting my crime.
One of them, who had been from the first the leader among those who had seized me, resolved to satisfy his own resentment, before he made me over to the higher powers.
The late setting of the moon, and the extreme caution I was obliged to use in this my third expedition, consumed so much time, that something like a qualm of fear came over me when I perceived dark night yield to twilight.
I crept along by the fern, on my hands and knees, seeking the shadowy coverts of the underwood, while the birds awoke with unwelcome song above, and the fresh morning wind, playing among the boughs, made me suspect a footfall at each turn.
My heart beat quick as I approached the palings; my hand was on one of them, a leap would take me to the other side, when two keepers sprang from an ambush upon me: one knocked me down, and proceeded to inflict a severe horse-whipping.
I started up--a knife was in my grasp; I made a plunge at his raised right arm, and inflicted a deep, wide wound in his hand.
The rage and yells of the wounded man, the howling execrations of his comrade, which I answered with equal bitterness and fury, echoed through the dell; morning broke more and more, ill accordant in its celestial beauty with our brute and noisy contest.
I and my enemy were still struggling, when the wounded man exclaimed, "The Earl"!
I sprang out of the herculean hold of the keeper, panting from my exertions; I cast furious glances on my persecutors, and placing myself with my back to a tree, resolved to defend myself to the last.
My garments were torn, and they, as well as my hands, were stained with the blood of the man I had wounded; one hand grasped the dead birds--my hard-earned prey, the other held the knife; my hair was matted; my face besmeared with the same guilty signs
Tall and muscular as I was in form, I must have looked like, what indeed I was, the merest ruffian that ever trod the earth.
The name of the Earl startled me, and caused all the indignant blood that warmed my heart to rush into my cheeks; I had never seen him before; I figured to myself a haughty, assuming youth, who would take me to task, if he deigned to speak to me, with all
My reply was ready; a reproach I deemed calculated to sting his very heart.
He came up the while; and his appearance blew aside, with gentle western breath, my cloudy wrath: a tall, slim, fair boy, with a physiognomy expressive of the excess of sensibility and refinement stood before me; the morning sunbeams tinged with gold his
"How is this"?
he cried.
The men eagerly began their defence; he put them aside, saying, "Two of you at once on a mere lad-- for shame"!
He came up to me: "Verney," he cried, "Lionel Verney, do we meet thus for the first time?
We were born to be friends to each other; and though ill fortune has divided us, will you not acknowledge the hereditary bond of friendship which I trust will hereafter unite us"?
As he spoke, his earnest eyes, fixed on me, seemed to read my very soul: my heart, my savage revengeful heart, felt the influence of sweet benignity sink upon it; while his thrilling voice, like sweetest melody, awoke a mute echo within me, stirring to its
I desired to reply, to acknowledge his goodness, accept his proffered friendship; but words, fitting words, were not afforded to the rough mountaineer; I would have held out my hand, but its guilty stain restrained me.
Adrian took pity on my faltering mien: "Come with me," he said, "I have much to say to you; come home with me--you know who I am"?
"Yes," I exclaimed, "I do believe that I now know you, and that you will pardon my mistakes--my crime".
Adrian smiled gently; and after giving his orders to the gamekeepers, he came up to me; putting his arm in mine, we walked together to the mansion.
It was not his rank--after all that I have said, surely it will not be suspected that it was Adrian's rank, that, from the first, subdued my heart of hearts, and laid my entire spirit prostrate before him.
Nor was it I alone who felt thus intimately his perfections.
His sensibility and courtesy fascinated every one.
His vivacity, intelligence, and active spirit of benevolence, completed the conquest.
Even at this early age, he was deep read and imbued with the spirit of high philosophy.
This spirit gave a tone of irresistible persuasion to his intercourse with others, so that he seemed like an inspired musician, who struck, with unerring skill, the "lyre of mind," and produced thence divine harmony.
In person, he hardly appeared of this world; his slight frame was overinformed by the soul that dwelt within; he was all mind; "Man but a rush against" his breast, and it would have conquered his strength; but the might of his smile would have tamed an
I spent the day with him.
At first he did not recur to the past, or indeed to any personal occurrences.
He wished probably to inspire me with confidence, and give me time to gather together my scattered thoughts.
He talked of general subjects, and gave me ideas I had never before conceived.
We sat in his library, and he spoke of the old Greek sages, and of the power which they had acquired over the minds of men, through the force of love and wisdom only.
The room was decorated with the busts of many of them, and he described their characters to me.
As he spoke, I felt subject to him; and all my boasted pride and strength were subdued by the honeyed accents of this blue-eyed boy.
The trim and paled demesne of civilization, which I had before regarded from my wild jungle as inaccessible, had its wicket opened by him; I stepped within, and felt, as I entered, that I trod my native soil.
As evening came on, he reverted to the past.
"I have a tale to relate," he said, "and much explanation to give concerning the past; perhaps you can assist me to curtail it.
Do you remember your father?
I had never the happiness of seeing him, but his name is one of my earliest recollections: he stands written in my mind's tablets as the type of all that was gallant, amiable, and fascinating in man.
His wit was not more conspicuous than the overflowing goodness of his heart, which he poured in such full measure on his friends, as to leave, alas!
small remnant for himself".
Encouraged by this encomium, I proceeded, in answer to his inquiries, to relate what I remembered of my parent; and he gave an account of those circumstances which had brought about a neglect of my father's testamentary letter.
When, in after times, Adrian's father, then king of England, felt his situation become more perilous, his line of conduct more embarrassed, again and again he wished for his early friend, who might stand a mound against the impetuous anger of his queen, a
From the time that he had quitted London, on the fatal night of his defeat at the gaming-table, the king had received no tidings concerning him; and when, after the lapse of years, he exerted himself to discover him, every trace was lost.
With fonder regret than ever, he clung to his memory; and gave it in charge to his son, if ever he should meet this valued friend, in his name to bestow every succour, and to assure him that, to the last, his attachment survived separation and silence.
A short time before Adrian's visit to Cumberland, the heir of the nobleman to whom my father had confided his last appeal to his royal master, put this letter, its seal unbroken, into the young Earl's hands.
It had been found cast aside with a mass of papers of old date, and accident alone brought it to light.
Adrian read it with deep interest; and found there that living spirit of genius and wit he had so often heard commemorated.
He discovered the name of the spot whither my father had retreated, and where he died; he learnt the existence of his orphan children; and during the short interval between his arrival at Ulswater and our meeting in the park, he had been occupied in making
The mode in which he spoke of my father was gratifying to my vanity; the veil which he delicately cast over his benevolence, in alledging a duteous fulfilment of the king's latest will, was soothing to my pride.
Other feelings, less ambiguous, were called into play by his conciliating manner and the generous warmth of his expressions, respect rarely before experienced, admiration, and love--he had touched my rocky heart with his magic power, and the stream of
In the evening we parted; he pressed my hand: "We shall meet again; come to me to-morrow".
I clasped that kind hand; I tried to answer; a fervent "God bless you"!
was all my ignorance could frame of speech, and I darted away, oppressed by my new emotions.
I could not rest.
I sought the hills; a west wind swept them, and the stars glittered above.
I ran on, careless of outward objects, but trying to master the struggling spirit within me by means of bodily fatigue.
"This," I thought, "is power!
Not to be strong of limb, hard of heart, ferocious, and daring; but kind compassionate and soft".
--Stopping short, I clasped my hands, and with the fervour of a new proselyte, cried, "Doubt me not, Adrian, I also will become wise and good"!
and then quite overcome, I wept aloud.
As this gust of passion passed from me, I felt more composed.
I lay on the ground, and giving the reins to my thoughts, repassed in my mind my former life; and began, fold by fold, to unwind the many errors of my heart, and to discover how brutish, savage, and worthless I had hitherto been.
I could not however at that time feel remorse, for methought I was born anew; my soul threw off the burthen of past sin, to commence a new career in innocence and love.
Nothing harsh or rough remained to jar with the soft feelings which the transactions of the day had inspired; I was as a child lisping its devotions after its mother, and my plastic soul was remoulded by a master hand, which I neither desired nor was able
This was the first commencement of my friendship with Adrian, and I must commemorate this day as the most fortunate of my life.
I now began to be human.
I was admitted within that sacred boundary which divides the intellectual and moral nature of man from that which characterizes animals.
My best feelings were called into play to give fitting responses to the generosity, wisdom, and amenity of my new friend.
He, with a noble goodness all his own, took infinite delight in bestowing to prodigality the treasures of his mind and fortune on the long-neglected son of his father's friend, the offspring of that gifted being whose excellencies and talents he had heard
After his abdication the late king had retreated from the sphere of politics, yet his domestic circle afforded him small content.
The ex-queen had none of the virtues of domestic life, and those of courage and daring which she possessed were rendered null by the secession of her husband: she despised him, and did not care to conceal her sentiments.
The king had, in compliance with her exactions, cast off his old friends, but he had acquired no new ones under her guidance.
In this dearth of sympathy, he had recourse to his almost infant son; and the early development of talent and sensibility rendered Adrian no unfitting depository of his father's confidence.
He was never weary of listening to the latter's often repeated accounts of old times, in which my father had played a distinguished part; his keen remarks were repeated to the boy, and remembered by him; his wit, his fascinations, his very faults were
Even the queen's dislike of the favourite was ineffectual to deprive him of his son's admiration: it was bitter, sarcastic, contemptuous--but as she bestowed her heavy censure alike on his virtues as his errors, on his devoted friendship and his
Nor did her angry dislike prevent Adrian from imaging my father, as he had said, the type of all that was gallant, amiable, and fascinating in man.
It was not strange therefore, that when he heard of the existence of the offspring of this celebrated person, he should have formed the plan of bestowing on them all the advantages his rank made him rich to afford.
When he found me a vagabond shepherd of the hills, a poacher, an unlettered savage, still his kindness did not fail.
In addition to the opinion he entertained that his father was to a degree culpable of neglect towards us, and that he was bound to every possible reparation, he was pleased to say that under all my ruggedness there glimmered forth an elevation of spirit,
Whatever those might be which descended to me, my noble young friend resolved should not be lost for want of culture.
Acting upon this plan in our subsequent intercourse, he led me to wish to participate in that cultivation which graced his own intellect.
My active mind, when once it seized upon this new idea, fastened on it with extreme avidity.
At first it was the great object of my ambition to rival the merits of my father, and render myself worthy of the friendship of Adrian.
But curiosity soon awoke, and an earnest love of knowledge, which caused me to pass days and nights in reading and study.
I was already well acquainted with what I may term the panorama of nature, the change of seasons, and the various appearances of heaven and earth.
But I was at once startled and enchanted by my sudden extension of vision, when the curtain, which had been drawn before the intellectual world, was withdrawn, and I saw the universe, not only as it presented itself to my outward senses, but as it had
Poetry and its creations, philosophy and its researches and classifications, alike awoke the sleeping ideas in my mind, and gave me new ones.
I felt as the sailor, who from the topmast first discovered the shore of America; and like him I hastened to tell my companions of my discoveries in unknown regions.
But I was unable to excite in any breast the same craving appetite for knowledge that existed in mine.
Even Perdita was unable to understand me.
I had lived in what is generally called the world of reality, and it was awakening to a new country to find that there was a deeper meaning in all I saw, besides that which my eyes conveyed to me.
The visionary Perdita beheld in all this only a new gloss upon an old reading, and her own was sufficiently inexhaustible to content her.
She listened to me as she had done to the narration of my adventures, and sometimes took an interest in this species of information; but she did not, as I did, look on it as an integral part of her being, which having obtained, I could no more put off than
We both agreed in loving Adrian: although she not having yet escaped from childhood could not appreciate as I did the extent of his merits, or feel the same sympathy in his pursuits and opinions.
I was for ever with him.
There was a sensibility and sweetness in his disposition, that gave a tender and unearthly tone to our converse.
Then he was gay as a lark carolling from its skiey tower, soaring in thought as an eagle, innocent as the mild-eyed dove.
He could dispel the seriousness of Perdita, and take the sting from the torturing activity of my nature.
I looked back to my restless desires and painful struggles with my fellow beings as to a troubled dream, and felt myself as much changed as if I had transmigrated into another form, whose fresh sensorium and mechanism of nerves had altered the reflection
But it was not so; I was the same in strength, in earnest craving for sympathy, in my yearning for active exertion.
My manly virtues did not desert me, for the witch Urania spared the locks of Sampson, while he reposed at her feet; but all was softened and humanized.
Nor did Adrian instruct me only in the cold truths of history and philosophy.
At the same time that he taught me by their means to subdue my own reckless and uncultured spirit, he opened to my view the living page of his own heart, and gave me to feel and understand its wondrous character.
The ex-queen of England had, even during infancy, endeavoured to implant daring and ambitious designs in the mind of her son.
She saw that he was endowed with genius and surpassing talent; these she cultivated for the sake of afterwards using them for the furtherance of her own views.
She encouraged his craving for knowledge and his impetuous courage; she even tolerated his tameless love of freedom, under the hope that this would, as is too often the case, lead to a passion for command.
She endeavoured to bring him up in a sense of resentment towards, and a desire to revenge himself upon, those who had been instrumental in bringing about his father's abdication.
In this she did not succeed.
The accounts furnished him, however distorted, of a great and wise nation asserting its right to govern itself, excited his admiration: in early days he became a republican from principle.
Still his mother did not despair.
To the love of rule and haughty pride of birth she added determined ambition, patience, and self-control.
She devoted herself to the study of her son's disposition.
By the application of praise, censure, and exhortation, she tried to seek and strike the fitting chords; and though the melody that followed her touch seemed discord to her, she built her hopes on his talents, and felt sure that she would at last win him.
The kind of banishment he now experienced arose from other causes.
The ex-queen had also a daughter, now twelve years of age; his fairy sister, Adrian was wont to call her; a lovely, animated, little thing, all sensibility and truth.
With these, her children, the noble widow constantly resided at Windsor; and admitted no visitors, except her own partizans, travellers from her native Germany, and a few of the foreign ministers.
Among these, and highly distinguished by her, was Prince Zaimi, ambassador to England from the free States of Greece; and his daughter, the young Princess Evadne, passed much of her time at Windsor Castle.
In company with this sprightly and clever Greek girl, the Countess would relax from her usual state.
Her views with regard to her own children, placed all her words and actions relative to them under restraint: but Evadne was a plaything she could in no way fear; nor were her talents and vivacity slight alleviations to the monotony of the Countess's life.
Evadne was eighteen years of age.
Although they spent much time together at Windsor, the extreme youth of Adrian prevented any suspicion as to the nature of their intercourse.
But he was ardent and tender of heart beyond the common nature of man, and had already learnt to love, while the beauteous Greek smiled benignantly on the boy.
It was strange to me, who, though older than Adrian, had never loved, to witness the whole heart's sacrifice of my friend.
There was neither jealousy, inquietude, or mistrust in his sentiment; it was devotion and faith.
His life was swallowed up in the existence of his beloved; and his heart beat only in unison with the pulsations that vivified hers.
This was the secret law of his life--he loved and was beloved.
The universe was to him a dwelling, to inhabit with his chosen one; and not either a scheme of society or an enchainment of events, that could impart to him either happiness or misery.
What, though life and the system of social intercourse were a wilderness, a tiger-haunted jungle!
Through the midst of its errors, in the depths of its savage recesses, there was a disentangled and flowery pathway, through which they might journey in safety and delight.
Their track would be like the passage of the Red Sea, which they might traverse with unwet feet, though a wall of destruction were impending on either side.
Alas!
why must I record the hapless delusion of this matchless specimen of humanity?
What is there in our nature that is for ever urging us on towards pain and misery?
We are not formed for enjoyment; and, however we may be attuned to the reception of pleasureable emotion, disappointment is the never-failing pilot of our life's bark, and ruthlessly carries us on to the shoals.
Who was better framed than this highly-gifted youth to love and be beloved, and to reap unalienable joy from an unblamed passion?
If his heart had slept but a few years longer, he might have been saved; but it awoke in its infancy; it had power, but no knowledge; and it was ruined, even as a too early-blowing bud is nipt by the killing frost.
I did not accuse Evadne of hypocrisy or a wish to deceive her lover; but the first letter that I saw of hers convinced me that she did not love him; it was written with elegance, and, foreigner as she was, with great command of language.
The hand-writing itself was exquisitely beautiful; there was something in her very paper and its folds, which even I, who did not love, and was withal unskilled in such matters, could discern as being tasteful.
There was much kindness, gratitude, and sweetness in her expression, but no love.
Evadne was two years older than Adrian; and who, at eighteen, ever loved one so much their junior?
I compared her placid epistles with the burning ones of Adrian.
His soul seemed to distil itself into the words he wrote; and they breathed on the paper, bearing with them a portion of the life of love, which was his life.
The very writing used to exhaust him; and he would weep over them, merely from the excess of emotion they awakened in his heart.
Adrian's soul was painted in his countenance, and concealment or deceit were at the antipodes to the dreadless frankness of his nature.
Evadne made it her earnest request that the tale of their loves should not be revealed to his mother; and after for a while contesting the point, he yielded it to her.
A vain concession; his demeanour quickly betrayed his secret to the quick eyes of the ex-queen.
With the same wary prudence that characterized her whole conduct, she concealed her discovery, but hastened to remove her son from the sphere of the attractive Greek.
He was sent to Cumberland; but the plan of correspondence between the lovers, arranged by Evadne, was effectually hidden from her.
Thus the absence of Adrian, concerted for the purpose of separating, united them in firmer bonds than ever.
To me he discoursed ceaselessly of his beloved Ionian.
Her country, its ancient annals, its late memorable struggles, were all made to partake in her glory and excellence.
He submitted to be away from her, because she commanded this submission; but for her influence, he would have declared his attachment before all England, and resisted, with unshaken constancy, his mother's opposition.
Evadne's feminine prudence perceived how useless any assertion of his resolves would be, till added years gave weight to his power.
Perhaps there was besides a lurking dislike to bind herself in the face of the world to one whom she did not love--not love, at least, with that passionate enthusiasm which her heart told her she might one day feel towards another.
He obeyed her injunctions, and passed a year in exile in Cumberland.
CHAPTER III.
HAPPY, thrice happy, were the months, and weeks, and hours of that year.
Friendship, hand in hand with admiration, tenderness and respect, built a bower of delight in my heart, late rough as an untrod wild in America, as the homeless wind or herbless sea.
Insatiate thirst for knowledge, and boundless affection for Adrian, combined to keep both my heart and understanding occupied, and I was consequently happy.
What happiness is so true and unclouded, as the overflowing and talkative delight of young people.
In our boat, upon my native lake, beside the streams and the pale bordering poplars--in valley and over hill, my crook thrown aside, a nobler flock to tend than silly sheep, even a flock of new-born ideas, I read or listened to Adrian; and his discourse,
Sometimes my lawless mood would return, my love of peril, my resistance to authority; but this was in his absence; under the mild sway of his dear eyes, I was obedient and good as a boy of five years old, who does his mother's bidding.
After a residence of about a year at Ulswater, Adrian visited London, and came back full of plans for our benefit.
You must begin life, he said: you are seventeen, and longer delay would render the necessary apprenticeship more and more irksome.
He foresaw that his own life would be one of struggle, and I must partake his labours with him.
The better to fit me for this task, we must now separate.
He found my name a good passport to preferment, and he had procured for me the situation of private secretary to the Ambassador at Vienna, where I should enter on my career under the best auspices.
In two years, I should return to my country, with a name well known and a reputation already founded.
And Perdita?
--Perdita was to become the pupil, friend and younger sister of Evadne.
With his usual thoughtfulness, he had provided for her independence in this situation.
How refuse the offers of this generous friend?
--I did not wish to refuse them; but in my heart of hearts, I made a vow to devote life, knowledge, and power, all of which, in as much as they were of any value, he had bestowed on me--all, all my capacities and hopes, to him alone I would devote.
Thus I promised myself, as I journied towards my destination with roused and ardent expectation: expectation of the fulfilment of all that in boyhood we promise ourselves of power and enjoyment in maturity.
Methought the time was now arrived, when, childish occupations laid aside, I should enter into life.
Even in the Elysian fields, Virgil describes the souls of the happy as eager to drink of the wave which was to restore them to this mortal coil.
The young are seldom in Elysium, for their desires, outstripping possibility, leave them as poor as a moneyless debtor.
We are told by the wisest philosophers of the dangers of the world, the deceits of men, and the treason of our own hearts: but not the less fearlessly does each put off his frail bark from the port, spread the sail, and strain his oar, to attain the
How few in youth's prime, moor their vessels on the "golden sands," and collect the painted shells that strew them.
But all at close of day, with riven planks and rent canvas make for shore, and are either wrecked ere they reach it, or find some wave-beaten haven, some desart strand, whereon to cast themselves and die unmourned.
A truce to philosophy!
--Life is before me, and I rush into possession.
Hope, glory, love, and blameless ambition are my guides, and my soul knows no dread.
What has been, though sweet, is gone; the present is good only because it is about to change, and the to come is all my own.
Do I fear, that my heart palpitates?
high aspirations cause the flow of my blood; my eyes seem to penetrate the cloudy midnight of time, and to discern within the depths of its darkness, the fruition of all my soul desires.
Now pause!
--During my journey I might dream, and with buoyant wings reach the summit of life's high edifice.
Now that I am arrived at its base, my pinions are furled, the mighty stairs are before me, and step by step I must ascend the wondrous fane-- Speak!
--What door is opened?
Behold me in a new capacity.
A diplomatist: one among the pleasure-seeking society of a gay city; a youth of promise; favourite of the Ambassador.
All was strange and admirable to the shepherd of Cumberland.
With breathless amaze I entered on the gay scene, whose actors were --the lilies glorious as Solomon, Who toil not, neither do they spin.
Soon, too soon, I entered the giddy whirl; forgetting my studious hours, and the companionship of Adrian.
Passionate desire of sympathy, and ardent pursuit for a wished-for object still characterized me.
The sight of beauty entranced me, and attractive manners in man or woman won my entire confidence.
I called it rapture, when a smile made my heart beat; and I felt the life's blood tingle in my frame, when I approached the idol which for awhile I worshipped.
The mere flow of animal spirits was Paradise, and at night's close I only desired a renewal of the intoxicating delusion.
The dazzling light of ornamented rooms; lovely forms arrayed in splendid dresses; the motions of a dance, the voluptuous tones of exquisite music, cradled my senses in one delightful dream.
And is not this in its kind happiness?
I appeal to moralists and sages.
I ask if in the calm of their measured reveries, if in the deep meditations which fill their hours, they feel the extasy of a youthful tyro in the school of pleasure?
Can the calm beams of their heaven-seeking eyes equal the flashes of mingling passion which blind his, or does the influence of cold philosophy steep their soul in a joy equal to his, engaged In this dear work of youthful revelry.
But in truth, neither the lonely meditations of the hermit, nor the tumultuous raptures of the reveller, are capable of satisfying man's heart.
From the one we gather unquiet speculation, from the other satiety.
The mind flags beneath the weight of thought, and droops in the heartless intercourse of those whose sole aim is amusement.
There is no fruition in their vacant kindness, and sharp rocks lurk beneath the smiling ripples of these shallow waters.
Thus I felt, when disappointment, weariness, and solitude drove me back upon my heart, to gather thence the joy of which it had become barren.
My flagging spirits asked for something to speak to the affections; and not finding it, I drooped.
Thus, notwithstanding the thoughtless delight that waited on its commencement, the impression I have of my life at Vienna is melancholy.
Goethe has said, that in youth we cannot be happy unless we love.
I did not love; but I was devoured by a restless wish to be something to others.
I became the victim of ingratitude and cold coquetry--then I desponded, and imagined that my discontent gave me a right to hate the world.
I receded to solitude; I had recourse to my books, and my desire again to enjoy the society of Adrian became a burning thirst.
Emulation, that in its excess almost assumed the venomous properties of envy, gave a sting to these feelings.
At this period the name and exploits of one of my countrymen filled the world with admiration.
Relations of what he had done, conjectures concerning his future actions, were the never-failing topics of the hour.
I was not angry on my own account, but I felt as if the praises which this idol received were leaves torn from laurels destined for Adrian.
But I must enter into some account of this darling of fame--this favourite of the wonder-loving world.
Lord Raymond was the sole remnant of a noble but impoverished family.
From early youth he had considered his pedigree with complacency, and bitterly lamented his want of wealth.
His first wish was aggrandisement; and the means that led towards this end were secondary considerations.
Haughty, yet trembling to every demonstration of respect; ambitious, but too proud to shew his ambition; willing to achieve honour, yet a votary of pleasure,-- he entered upon life.
He was met on the threshold by some insult, real or imaginary; some repulse, where he least expected it; some disappointment, hard for his pride to bear.
He writhed beneath an injury he was unable to revenge; and he quitted England with a vow not to return, till the good time should arrive, when she might feel the power of him she now despised.
He became an adventurer in the Greek wars.
His reckless courage and comprehensive genius brought him into notice.
He became the darling hero of this rising people.
His foreign birth, and he refused to throw off his allegiance to his native country, alone prevented him from filling the first offices in the state.
But, though others might rank higher in title and ceremony, Lord Raymond held a station above and beyond all this.
He led the Greek armies to victory; their triumphs were all his own.
When he appeared, whole towns poured forth their population to meet him; new songs were adapted to their national airs, whose themes were his glory, valour, and munificence.
A truce was concluded between the Greeks and Turks.
At the same time, Lord Raymond, by some unlooked-for chance, became the possessor of an immense fortune in England, whither he returned, crowned with glory, to receive the meed of honour and distinction before denied to his pretensions.
His proud heart rebelled against this change.
In what was the despised Raymond not the same?
If the acquisition of power in the shape of wealth caused this alteration, that power should they feel as an iron yoke.
Power therefore was the aim of all his endeavours; aggrandizement the mark at which he for ever shot.
In open ambition or close intrigue, his end was the same--to attain the first station in his own country.
This account filled me with curiosity.
The events that in succession followed his return to England, gave me keener feelings.
Among his other advantages, Lord Raymond was supremely handsome; every one admired him; of women he was the idol.
He was courteous, honey-tongued--an adept in fascinating arts.
What could not this man achieve in the busy English world?
Change succeeded to change; the entire history did not reach me; for Adrian had ceased to write, and Perdita was a laconic correspondent.
The rumour went that Adrian had become--how write the fatal word--mad: that Lord Raymond was the favourite of the ex-queen, her daughter's destined husband.
Nay, more, that this aspiring noble revived the claim of the house of Windsor to the crown, and that, on the event of Adrian's incurable disorder and his marriage with the sister, the brow of the ambitious Raymond might be encircled with the magic ring of
Such a tale filled the trumpet of many voiced fame; such a tale rendered my longer stay at Vienna, away from the friend of my youth, intolerable.
Now I must fulfil my vow; now range myself at his side, and be his ally and support till death.
Farewell to courtly pleasure; to politic intrigue; to the maze of passion and folly!
All hail, England!
Native England, receive thy child!
thou art the scene of all my hopes, the mighty theatre on which is acted the only drama that can, heart and soul, bear me along with it in its development.
A voice most irresistible, a power omnipotent, drew me thither.
After an absence of two years I landed on its shores, not daring to make any inquiries, fearful of every remark.
My first visit would be to my sister, who inhabited a little cottage, a part of Adrian's gift, on the borders of Windsor Forest.
From her I should learn the truth concerning our protector; I should hear why she had withdrawn from the protection of the Princess Evadne, and be instructed as to the influence which this overtopping and towering Raymond exercised over the fortunes of my
I had never before been in the neighbourhood of Windsor; the fertility and beauty of the country around now struck me with admiration, which encreased as I approached the antique wood.
The ruins of majestic oaks which had grown, flourished, and decayed during the progress of centuries, marked where the limits of the forest once reached, while the shattered palings and neglected underwood shewed that this part was deserted for the younger
Perdita's humble dwelling was situated on the skirts of the most ancient portion; before it was stretched Bishopgate Heath, which towards the east appeared interminable, and was bounded to the west by Chapel Wood and the grove of Virginia Water.
Behind, the cottage was shadowed by the venerable fathers of the forest, under which the deer came to graze, and which for the most part hollow and decayed, formed fantastic groups that contrasted with the regular beauty of the younger trees.
These, the offspring of a later period, stood erect and seemed ready to advance fearlessly into coming time; while those out worn stragglers, blasted and broke, clung to each other, their weak boughs sighing as the wind buffetted them--a weather-beaten
A light railing surrounded the garden of the cottage, which, low-roofed, seemed to submit to the majesty of nature, and cower amidst the venerable remains of forgotten time.
Flowers, the children of the spring, adorned her garden and casements; in the midst of lowliness there was an air of elegance which spoke the graceful taste of the inmate.
With a beating heart I entered the enclosure; as I stood at the entrance, I heard her voice, melodious as it had ever been, which before I saw her assured me of her welfare.
A moment more and Perdita appeared; she stood before me in the fresh bloom of youthful womanhood, different from and yet the same as the mountain girl I had left.
Her eyes could not be deeper than they were in childhood, nor her countenance more expressive; but the expression was changed and improved; intelligence sat on her brow; when she smiled her face was embellished by the softest sensibility, and her low,
Her person was formed in the most feminine proportions; she was not tall, but her mountain life had given freedom to her motions, so that her light step scarce made her foot-fall heard as she tript across the hall to meet me.
When we had parted, I had clasped her to my bosom with unrestrained warmth; we met again, and new feelings were awakened; when each beheld the other, childhood passed, as full grown actors on this changeful scene.
The pause was but for a moment; the flood of association and natural feeling which had been checked, again rushed in full tide upon our hearts, and with tenderest emotion we were swiftly locked in each other's embrace.
This burst of passionate feeling over, with calmed thoughts we sat together, talking of the past and present.
I alluded to the coldness of her letters; but the few minutes we had spent together sufficiently explained the origin of this.
New feelings had arisen within her, which she was unable to express in writing to one whom she had only known in childhood; but we saw each other again, and our intimacy was renewed as if nothing had intervened to check it.
I detailed the incidents of my sojourn abroad, and then questioned her as to the changes that had taken place at home, the causes of Adrian's absence, and her secluded life.
The tears that suffused my sister's eyes when I mentioned our friend, and her heightened colour seemed to vouch for the truth of the reports that had reached me.
But their import was too terrible for me to give instant credit to my suspicion.
Was there indeed anarchy in the sublime universe of Adrian's thoughts, did madness scatter the well-appointed legions, and was he no longer the lord of his own soul?
Beloved friend, this ill world was no clime for your gentle spirit; you delivered up its governance to false humanity, which stript it of its leaves ere winter-time, and laid bare its quivering life to the evil ministration of roughest winds.
Have those gentle eyes, those "channels of the soul" lost their meaning, or do they only in their glare disclose the horrible tale of its aberrations?
Does that voice no longer "discourse excellent music"?
Horrible, most horrible!
I veil my eyes in terror of the change, and gushing tears bear witness to my sympathy for this unimaginable ruin.
In obedience to my request Perdita detailed the melancholy circumstances that led to this event.
The frank and unsuspicious mind of Adrian, gifted as it was by every natural grace, endowed with transcendant powers of intellect, unblemished by the shadow of defect (unless his dreadless independence of thought was to be construed into one), was devoted,
He entrusted to her keeping the treasures of his soul, his aspirations after excellence, and his plans for the improvement of mankind.
As manhood dawned upon him, his schemes and theories, far from being changed by personal and prudential motives, acquired new strength from the powers he felt arise within him; and his love for Evadne became deep-rooted, as he each day became more certain
In solitude, and through many wanderings afar from the haunts of men, he matured his views for the reform of the English government, and the improvement of the people.
It would have been well if he had concealed his sentiments, until he had come into possession of the power which would secure their practical development.
But he was impatient of the years that must intervene, he was frank of heart and fearless.
He gave not only a brief denial to his mother's schemes, but published his intention of using his influence to diminish the power of the aristocracy, to effect a greater equalization of wealth and privilege, and to introduce a perfect system of republican
At first his mother treated his theories as the wild ravings of inexperience.
But they were so systematically arranged, and his arguments so well supported, that though still in appearance incredulous, she began to fear him.
She tried to reason with him, and finding him inflexible, learned to hate him.
Strange to say, this feeling was infectious.
His enthusiasm for good which did not exist; his contempt for the sacredness of authority; his ardour and imprudence were all at the antipodes of the usual routine of life; the worldly feared him; the young and inexperienced did not understand the lofty
Evadne entered but coldly into his systems.
She thought he did well to assert his own will, but she wished that will to have been more intelligible to the multitude.
She had none of the spirit of a martyr, and did not incline to share the shame and defeat of a fallen patriot.
She was aware of the purity of his motives, the generosity of his disposition, his true and ardent attachment to her; and she entertained a great affection for him.
He repaid this spirit of kindness with the fondest gratitude, and made her the treasure-house of all his hopes.
At this time Lord Raymond returned from Greece.
No two persons could be more opposite than Adrian and he.
With all the incongruities of his character, Raymond was emphatically a man of the world.
His passions were violent; as these often obtained the mastery over him, he could not always square his conduct to the obvious line of self-interest, but self-gratification at least was the paramount object with him.
He looked on the structure of society as but a part of the machinery which supported the web on which his life was traced.
The earth was spread out as an highway for him; the heavens built up as a canopy for him.
Adrian felt that he made a part of a great whole.
He owned affinity not only with mankind, but all nature was akin to him; the mountains and sky were his friends; the winds of heaven and the offspring of earth his playmates; while he the focus only of this mighty mirror, felt his life mingle with the
His soul was sympathy, and dedicated to the worship of beauty and excellence.
Adrian and Raymond now came into contact, and a spirit of aversion rose between them.
Adrian despised the narrow views of the politician, and Raymond held in supreme contempt the benevolent visions of the philanthropist.
With the coming of Raymond was formed the storm that laid waste at one fell blow the gardens of delight and sheltered paths which Adrian fancied that he had secured to himself, as a refuge from defeat and contumely.
Raymond, the deliverer of Greece, the graceful soldier, who bore in his mien a tinge of all that, peculiar to her native clime, Evadne cherished as most dear-- Raymond was loved by Evadne.
Overpowered by her new sensations, she did not pause to examine them, or to regulate her conduct by any sentiments except the tyrannical one which suddenly usurped the empire of her heart.
She yielded to its influence, and the too natural consequence in a mind unattuned to soft emotions was, that the attentions of Adrian became distasteful to her.
She grew capricious; her gentle conduct towards him was exchanged for asperity and repulsive coldness.
When she perceived the wild or pathetic appeal of his expressive countenance, she would relent, and for a while resume her ancient kindness.
But these fluctuations shook to its depths the soul of the sensitive youth; he no longer deemed the world subject to him, because he possessed Evadne's love; he felt in every nerve that the dire storms of the mental universe were about to attack his
Perdita, who then resided with Evadne, saw the torture that Adrian endured.
She loved him as a kind elder brother; a relation to guide, protect, and instruct her, without the too frequent tyranny of parental authority.
She adored his virtues, and with mixed contempt and indignation she saw Evadne pile drear sorrow on his head, for the sake of one who hardly marked her.
In his solitary despair Adrian would often seek my sister, and in covered terms express his misery, while fortitude and agony divided the throne of his mind.
Soon, alas!
was one to conquer.
Anger made no part of his emotion.
With whom should he be angry?
Not with Raymond, who was unconscious of the misery he occasioned; not with Evadne, for her his soul wept tears of blood--poor, mistaken girl, slave not tyrant was she, and amidst his own anguish he grieved for her future destiny.
Once a writing of his fell into Perdita's hands; it was blotted with tears--well might any blot it with the like-- "Life"--it began thus--"is not the thing romance writers describe it; going through the measures of a dance, and after various evolutions
While there is life there is action and change.
We go on, each thought linked to the one which was its parent, each act to a previous act.
No joy or sorrow dies barren of progeny, which for ever generated and generating, weaves the chain that make our life: Un dia llama a otro dia y ass i llama, y encadena llanto a llanto, y pena a pena.
Truly disappointment is the guardian deity of human life; she sits at the threshold of unborn time, and marshals the events as they come forth.
Once my heart sat lightly in my bosom; all the beauty of the world was doubly beautiful, irradiated by the sun-light shed from my own soul.
O wherefore are love and ruin for ever joined in this our mortal dream?
So that when we make our hearts a lair for that gently seeming beast, its companion enters with it, and pitilessly lays waste what might have been an home and a shelter".
By degrees his health was shaken by his misery, and then his intellect yielded to the same tyranny.
His manners grew wild; he was sometimes ferocious, sometimes absorbed in speechless melancholy.
Suddenly Evadne quitted London for Paris; he followed, and overtook her when the vessel was about to sail; none knew what passed between them, but Perdita had never seen him since; he lived in seclusion, no one knew where, attended by such persons as his
CHAPTER IV.
THE next day Lord Raymond called at Perdita's cottage, on his way to Windsor Castle.
My sister's heightened colour and sparkling eyes half revealed her secret to me.
He was perfectly self-possessed; he accosted us both with courtesy, seemed immediately to enter into our feelings, and to make one with us.
I scanned his physiognomy, which varied as he spoke, yet was beautiful in every change.
The usual expression of his eyes was soft, though at times he could make them even glare with ferocity; his complexion was colourless; and every trait spoke predominate self-will; his smile was pleasing, though disdain too often curled his lips--lips which
His voice, usually gentle, often startled you by a sharp discordant note, which shewed that his usual low tone was rather the work of study than nature.
Thus full of contradictions, unbending yet haughty, gentle yet fierce, tender and again neglectful, he by some strange art found easy entrance to the admiration and affection of women; now caressing and now tyrannizing over them according to his mood, but
At the present time Raymond evidently wished to appear amiable.
Wit, hilarity, and deep observation were mingled in his talk, rendering every sentence that he uttered as a flash of light.
He soon conquered my latent distaste; I endeavoured to watch him and Perdita, and to keep in mind every thing I had heard to his disadvantage.
But all appeared so ingenuous, and all was so fascinating, that I forgot everything except the pleasure his society afforded me.
Under the idea of initiating me in the scene of English politics and society, of which I was soon to become a part, he narrated a number of anecdotes, and sketched many characters; his discourse, rich and varied, flowed on, pervading all my senses with
But for one thing he would have been completely triumphant.
He alluded to Adrian, and spoke of him with that disparagement that the worldly wise always attach to enthusiasm.
He perceived the cloud gathering, and tried to dissipate it; but the strength of my feelings would not permit me to pass thus lightly over this sacred subject; so I said emphatically, "Permit me to remark, that I am devotedly attached to the Earl of
I reverence his goodness, I accord with his opinions, and bitterly lament his present, and I trust temporary, illness.
That illness, from its peculiarity, makes it painful to me beyond words to hear him mentioned, unless in terms of respect and affection".
Raymond replied; but there was nothing conciliatory in his reply.
I saw that in his heart he despised those dedicated to any but worldly idols.
"Every man," he said, "dreams about something, love, honour, and pleasure; you dream of friendship, and devote yourself to a maniac; well, if that be your vocation, doubtless you are in the right to follow it".
-- Some reflection seemed to sting him, and the spasm of pain that for a moment convulsed his countenance, checked my indignation.
"Happy are dreamers," he continued, "so that they be not awakened!
Would I could dream!
but 'broad and garish day' is the element in which I live; the dazzling glare of reality inverts the scene for me.
Even the ghost of friendship has departed, and love"----He broke off; nor could I guess whether the disdain that curled his lip was directed against the passion, or against himself for being its slave.
This account may be taken as a sample of my intercourse with Lord Raymond.
I became intimate with him, and each day afforded me occasion to admire more and more his powerful and versatile talents, that together with his eloquence, which was graceful and witty, and his wealth now immense, caused him to be feared, loved, and hated
My descent, which claimed interest, if not respect, my former connection with Adrian, the favour of the ambassador, whose secretary I had been, and now my intimacy with Lord Raymond, gave me easy access to the fashionable and political circles of England.
To my inexperience we at first appeared on the eve of a civil war; each party was violent, acrimonious, and unyielding.
Parliament was divided by three factions, aristocrats, democrats, and royalists.
After Adrian's declared predeliction to the republican form of government, the latter party had nearly died away, chiefless, guideless; but, when Lord Raymond came forward as its leader, it revived with redoubled force.
Some were royalists from prejudice and ancient affection, and there were many moderately inclined who feared alike the capricious tyranny of the popular party, and the unbending despotism of the aristocrats.
More than a third of the members ranged themselves under Raymond, and their number was perpetually encreasing.
The aristocrats built their hopes on their preponderant wealth and influence; the reformers on the force of the nation itself; the debates were violent, more violent the discourses held by each knot of politicians as they assembled to arrange their
Opprobrious epithets were bandied about, resistance even to the death threatened; meetings of the populace disturbed the quiet order of the country; except in war, how could all this end?
Even as the destructive flames were ready to break forth, I saw them shrink back; allayed by the absence of the military, by the aversion entertained by every one to any violence, save that of speech, and by the cordial politeness and even friendship of
I was from a thousand motives induced to attend minutely to the course of events, and watch each turn with intense anxiety.
I could not but perceive that Perdita loved Raymond; methought also that he regarded the fair daughter of Verney with admiration and tenderness.
Yet I knew that he was urging forward his marriage with the presumptive heiress of the Earldom of Windsor, with keen expectation of the advantages that would thence accrue to him.
All the ex-queen's friends were his friends; no week passed that he did not hold consultations with her at Windsor.
I had never seen the sister of Adrian.
I had heard that she was lovely, amiable, and fascinating.
Wherefore should I see her?
There are times when we have an indefinable sentiment of impending change for better or for worse, to arise from an event; and, be it for better or for worse, we fear the change, and shun the event.
For this reason I avoided this high-born damsel.
To me she was everything and nothing; her very name mentioned by another made me start and tremble; the endless discussion concerning her union with Lord Raymond was real agony to me.
Methought that, Adrian withdrawn from active life, and this beauteous Idris, a victim probably to her mother's ambitious schemes, I ought to come forward to protect her from undue influence, guard her from unhappiness, and secure to her freedom of choice,
Yet how was I to do this?
She herself would disdain my interference.
Since then I must be an object of indifference or contempt to her, better, far better avoid her, nor expose myself before her and the scornful world to the chance of playing the mad game of a fond, foolish Icarus.
One day, several months after my return to England, I quitted London to visit my sister.
Her society was my chief solace and delight; and my spirits always rose at the expectation of seeing her.
Her conversation was full of pointed remark and discernment; in her pleasant alcove, redolent with sweetest flowers, adorned by magnificent casts, antique vases, and copies of the finest pictures of Raphael, Correggio, and Claude, painted by herself, I
On this occasion, my sister was not alone; nor could I fail to recognise her companion: it was Idris, the till now unseen object of my mad idolatry.
In what fitting terms of wonder and delight, in what choice expression and soft flow of language, can I usher in the loveliest, wisest, best?
How in poor assemblage of words convey the halo of glory that surrounded her, the thousand graces that waited unwearied on her.
The first thing that struck you on beholding that charming countenance was its perfect goodness and frankness; candour sat upon her brow, simplicity in her eyes, heavenly benignity in her smile.
Her tall slim figure bent gracefully as a poplar to the breezy west, and her gait, goddess-like, was as that of a winged angel new alit from heaven's high floor; the pearly fairness of her complexion was stained by a pure suffusion; her voice resembled the
It is easiest perhaps to describe by contrast.
I have detailed the perfections of my sister; and yet she was utterly unlike Idris.
Perdita, even where she loved, was reserved and timid; Idris was frank and confiding.
The one recoiled to solitude, that she might there entrench herself from disappointment and injury; the other walked forth in open day, believing that none would harm her.
Wordsworth has compared a beloved female to two fair objects in nature; but his lines always appeared to me rather a contrast than a similitude: A violet by a mossy stone Half hidden from the eye, Fair as a star when only one Is shining in the sky.
Such a violet was sweet Perdita, trembling to entrust herself to the very air, cowering from observation, yet betrayed by her excellences; and repaying with a thousand graces the labour of those who sought her in her lonely bye-path.
Idris was as the star, set in single splendour in the dim anadem of balmy evening; ready to enlighten and delight the subject world, shielded herself from every taint by her unimagined distance from all that was not like herself akin to heaven.
I found this vision of beauty in Perdita's alcove, in earnest conversation with its inmate.
When my sister saw me, she rose, and taking my hand, said, "He is here, even at our wish; this is Lionel, my brother".
Idris arose also, and bent on me her eyes of celestial blue, and with grace peculiar said--"You hardly need an introduction; we have a picture, highly valued by my father, which declares at once your name.
Verney, you will acknowledge this tie, and as my brother's friend, I feel that I may trust you".
Then, with lids humid with a tear and trembling voice, she continued-- "Dear friends, do not think it strange that now, visiting you for the first time, I ask your assistance, and confide my wishes and fears to you.
To you alone do I dare speak; I have heard you commended by impartial spectators; you are my brother's friends, therefore you must be mine.
What can I say?
if you refuse to aid me, I am lost indeed"!
She cast up her eyes, while wonder held her auditors mute; then, as if carried away by her feelings, she cried--"My brother!
beloved, ill-fated Adrian!
how speak of your misfortunes?
Doubtless you have both heard the current tale; perhaps believe the slander; but he is not mad!
Were an angel from the foot of God's throne to assert it, never, never would I believe it.
He is wronged, betrayed, imprisoned--save him!
Verney, you must do this; seek him out in whatever part of the island he is immured; find him, rescue him from his persecutors, restore him to himself, to me--on the wide earth I have none to love but only him"!
Her earnest appeal, so sweetly and passionately expressed, filled me with wonder and sympathy; and, when she added, with thrilling voice and look, "Do you consent to undertake this enterprize"?
I vowed, with energy and truth, to devote myself in life and death to the restoration and welfare of Adrian.
We then conversed on the plan I should pursue, and discussed the probable means of discovering his residence.
While we were in earnest discourse, Lord Raymond entered unannounced: I saw Perdita tremble and grow deadly pale, and the cheeks of Idris glow with purest blushes.
He must have been astonished at our conclave, disturbed by it I should have thought; but nothing of this appeared; he saluted my companions, and addressed me with a cordial greeting.
Idris appeared suspended for a moment, and then with extreme sweetness, she said, "Lord Raymond, I confide in your goodness and honour".
Smiling haughtily, he bent his head, and replied, with emphasis, "Do you indeed confide, Lady Idris"?
She endeavoured to read his thought, and then answered with dignity, "As you please.
It is certainly best not to compromise oneself by any concealment".
"Pardon me," he replied, "if I have offended.
Whether you trust me or not, rely on my doing my utmost to further your wishes, whatever they may be".
Idris smiled her thanks, and rose to take leave.
Lord Raymond requested permission to accompany her to Windsor Castle, to which she consented, and they quitted the cottage together.
My sister and I were left--truly like two fools, who fancied that they had obtained a golden treasure, till daylight shewed it to be lead--two silly, luckless flies, who had played in sunbeams and were caught in a spider's web.
I leaned against the casement, and watched those two glorious creatures, till they disappeared in the forest-glades; and then I turned.
Perdita had not moved; her eyes fixed on the ground, her cheeks pale, her very lips white, motionless and rigid, every feature stamped by woe, she sat.
Half frightened, I would have taken her hand; but she shudderingly withdrew it, and strove to collect herself.
I entreated her to speak to me: "Not now," she replied, "nor do you speak to me, my dear Lionel; you can say nothing, for you know nothing.
I will see you to-morrow; in the meantime, adieu"!
She rose, and walked from the room; but pausing at the door, and leaning against it, as if her over-busy thoughts had taken from her the power of supporting herself, she said, "Lord Raymond will probably return.
Will you tell him that he must excuse me to-day, for I am not well.
I will see him to-morrow if he wishes it, and you also.
You had better return to London with him; you can there make the enquiries agreed upon, concerning the Earl of Windsor and visit me again to-morrow, before you proceed on your journey--till then, farewell"!
She spoke falteringly, and concluded with a heavy sigh.
I gave my assent to her request; and she left me.
I felt as if, from the order of the systematic world, I had plunged into chaos, obscure, contrary, unintelligible.
That Raymond should marry Idris was more than ever intolerable; yet my passion, though a giant from its birth, was too strange, wild, and impracticable, for me to feel at once the misery I perceived in Perdita.
How should I act?
She had not confided in me; I could not demand an explanation from Raymond without the hazard of betraying what was perhaps her most treasured secret.
I would obtain the truth from her the following day--in the mean time--But, while I was occupied by multiplying reflections, Lord Raymond returned.
He asked for my sister; and I delivered her message.
After musing on it for a moment, he asked me if I were about to return to London, and if I would accompany him: I consented.
He was full of thought, and remained silent during a considerable part of our ride; at length he said, "I must apologize to you for my abstraction; the truth is, Ryland's motion comes on to-night, and I am considering my reply".
Ryland was the leader of the popular party, a hard-headed man, and in his way eloquent; he had obtained leave to bring in a bill making it treason to endeavour to change the present state of the English government and the standing laws of the republic.
This attack was directed against Raymond and his machinations for the restoration of the monarchy.
Raymond asked me if I would accompany him to the House that evening.
I remembered my pursuit for intelligence concerning Adrian; and, knowing that my time would be fully occupied, I excused myself.
"Nay," said my companion, "I can free you from your present impediment.
You are going to make enquiries concerning the Earl of Windsor.
I can answer them at once, he is at the Duke of Athol's seat at Dunkeld.
On the first approach of his disorder, he travelled about from one place to another; until, arriving at that romantic seclusion he refused to quit it, and we made arrangements with the Duke for his continuing there".
I was hurt by the careless tone with which he conveyed this information, and replied coldly: "I am obliged to you for your intelligence, and will avail myself of it".
"You shall, Verney," said he, "and if you continue of the same mind, I will facilitate your views.
But first witness, I beseech you, the result of this night's contest, and the triumph I am about to achieve, if I may so call it, while I fear that victory is to me defeat.
What can I do?
My dearest hopes appear to be near their fulfilment.
The ex-queen gives me Idris; Adrian is totally unfitted to succeed to the earldom, and that earldom in my hands becomes a kingdom.
By the reigning God it is true; the paltry earldom of Windsor shall no longer content him, who will inherit the rights which must for ever appertain to the person who possesses it.
The Countess can never forget that she has been a queen, and she disdains to leave a diminished inheritance to her children; her power and my wit will rebuild the throne, and this brow will be clasped by a kingly diadem.
--I can do this--I can marry Idris".
--- He stopped abruptly, his countenance darkened, and its expression changed again and again under the influence of internal passion.
I asked, "Does Lady Idris love you"?
"What a question," replied he laughing.
"She will of course, as I shall her, when we are married".
"You begin late," said I, ironically, "marriage is usually considered the grave, and not the cradle of love.
So you are about to love her, but do not already"?
"Do not catechise me, Lionel; I will do my duty by her, be assured.
Love!
I must steel my heart against that; expel it from its tower of strength, barricade it out: the fountain of love must cease to play, its waters be dried up, and all passionate thoughts attendant on it die--that is to say, the love which would rule me, not
Idris is a gentle, pretty, sweet little girl; it is impossible not to have an affection for her, and I have a very sincere one; only do not speak of love --love, the tyrant and the tyrant-queller; love, until now my conqueror, now my slave; the hungry
Tell me, Lionel, do you consent that I should marry this young lady"?
He bent his keen eyes upon me, and my uncontrollable heart swelled in my bosom.
I replied in a calm voice--but how far from calm was the thought imaged by my still words--"Never!
I can never consent that Lady Idris should be united to one who does not love her".
"Because you love her yourself".
"Your Lordship might have spared that taunt; I do not, dare not love her".
"At least," he continued haughtily, "she does not love you.
I would not marry a reigning sovereign, were I not sure that her heart was free.
But, O, Lionel!
a kingdom is a word of might, and gently sounding are the terms that compose the style of royalty.
Were not the mightiest men of the olden times kings?
Alexander was a king; Solomon, the wisest of men, was a king; Napoleon was a king; Caesar died in his attempt to become one, and Cromwell, the puritan and king-killer, aspired to regality.
The father of Adrian yielded up the already broken sceptre of England; but I will rear the fallen plant, join its dismembered frame, and exalt it above all the flowers of the field.
"You need not wonder that I freely discover Adrian's abode.
Do not suppose that I am wicked or foolish enough to found my purposed sovereignty on a fraud, and one so easily discovered as the truth or falsehood of the Earl's insanity.
I am just come from him.
Before I decided on my marriage with Idris, I resolved to see him myself again, and to judge of the probability of his recovery.
--He is irrecoverably mad".
I gasped for breath-- "I will not detail to you," continued Raymond, "the melancholy particulars.
You shall see him, and judge for yourself; although I fear this visit, useless to him, will be insufferably painful to you.
It has weighed on my spirits ever since.
Excellent and gentle as he is even in the downfall of his reason, I do not worship him as you do, but I would give all my hopes of a crown and my right hand to boot, to see him restored to himself".
His voice expressed the deepest compassion: "Thou most unaccountable being," I cried, "whither will thy actions tend, in all this maze of purpose in which thou seemest lost"?
"Whither indeed?
To a crown, a golden be-gemmed crown, I hope; and yet I dare not trust and though I dream of a crown and wake for one, ever and anon a busy devil whispers to me, that it is but a fool's cap that I seek, and that were I wise, I should trample on it, and
"And what is that"?
"If I do make it my choice, then you shall know; at present I dare not speak, even think of it".
Again he was silent, and after a pause turned to me laughingly.
When scorn did not inspire his mirth, when it was genuine gaiety that painted his features with a joyous expression, his beauty became super-eminent, divine.
"Verney," said he, "my first act when I become King of England, will be to unite with the Greeks, take Constantinople, and subdue all Asia.
I intend to be a warrior, a conqueror; Napoleon's name shall vail to mine; and enthusiasts, instead of visiting his rocky grave, and exalting the merits of the fallen, shall adore my majesty, and magnify my illustrious achievements".
I listened to Raymond with intense interest.
Could I be other than all ear, to one who seemed to govern the whole earth in his grasping imagination, and who only quailed when he attempted to rule himself.
Then on his word and will depended my own happiness--the fate of all dear to me.
I endeavoured to divine the concealed meaning of his words.
Perdita's name was not mentioned; yet I could not doubt that love for her caused the vacillation of purpose that he exhibited.
And who was so worthy of love as my noble-minded sister?
Who deserved the hand of this self-exalted king more than she whose glance belonged to a queen of nations?
who loved him, as he did her; notwithstanding that disappointment quelled her passion, and ambition held strong combat with his.
We went together to the House in the evening.
Raymond, while he knew that his plans and prospects were to be discussed and decided during the expected debate, was gay and careless.
An hum, like that of ten thousand hives of swarming bees, stunned us as we entered the coffee-room.
Knots of politicians were assembled with anxious brows and loud or deep voices.
The aristocratical party, the richest and most influential men in England, appeared less agitated than the others, for the question was to be discussed without their interference.
Near the fire was Ryland and his supporters.
Ryland was a man of obscure birth and of immense wealth, inherited from his father, who had been a manufacturer.
He had witnessed, when a young man, the abdication of the king, and the amalgamation of the two houses of Lords and Commons; he had sympathized with these popular encroachments, and it had been the business of his life to consolidate and encrease them.
Since then, the influence of the landed proprietors had augmented; and at first Ryland was not sorry to observe the machinations of Lord Raymond, which drew off many of his opponent's partizans.
But the thing was now going too far.
The poorer nobility hailed the return of sovereignty, as an event which would restore them to their power and rights, now lost.
The half extinct spirit of royalty roused itself in the minds of men; and they, willing slaves, self-constituted subjects, were ready to bend their necks to the yoke.
Some erect and manly spirits still remained, pillars of state; but the word republic had grown stale to the vulgar ear; and many--the event would prove whether it was a majority-- pined for the tinsel and show of royalty.
Ryland was roused to resistance; he asserted that his sufferance alone had permitted the encrease of this party; but the time for indulgence was passed, and with one motion of his arm he would sweep away the cobwebs that blinded his countrymen.
When Raymond entered the coffee-room, his presence was hailed by his friends almost with a shout.
They gathered round him, counted their numbers, and detailed the reasons why they were now to receive an addition of such and such members, who had not yet declared themselves.
Some trifling business of the House having been gone through, the leaders took their seats in the chamber; the clamour of voices continued, till Ryland arose to speak, and then the slightest whispered observation was audible.
All eyes were fixed upon him as he stood--ponderous of frame, sonorous of voice, and with a manner which, though not graceful, was impressive.
I turned from his marked, iron countenance to Raymond, whose face, veiled by a smile, would not betray his care; yet his lips quivered somewhat, and his hand clasped the bench on which he sat, with a convulsive strength that made the muscles start again.
Ryland began by praising the present state of the British empire.
He recalled past years to their memory; the miserable contentions which in the time of our fathers arose almost to civil war, the abdication of the late king, and the foundation of the republic.
He described this republic; shewed how it gave privilege to each individual in the state, to rise to consequence, and even to temporary sovereignty.
He compared the royal and republican spirit; shewed how the one tended to enslave the minds of men; while all the institutions of the other served to raise even the meanest among us to something great and good.
He shewed how England had become powerful, and its inhabitants valiant and wise, by means of the freedom they enjoyed.
As he spoke, every heart swelled with pride, and every cheek glowed with delight to remember, that each one there was English, and that each supported and contributed to the happy state of things now commemorated.
Ryland's fervour increased--his eyes lighted up--his voice assumed the tone of passion.
There was one man, he continued, who wished to alter all this, and bring us back to our days of impotence and contention:--one man, who would dare arrogate the honour which was due to all who claimed England as their birthplace, and set his name and style
I saw at this juncture that Raymond changed colour; his eyes were withdrawn from the orator, and cast on the ground; the listeners turned from one to the other; but in the meantime the speaker's voice filled their ears--the thunder of his denunciations
The very boldness of his language gave him weight; each knew that he spoke truth--a truth known, but not acknowledged.
He tore from reality the mask with which she had been clothed; and the purposes of Raymond, which before had crept around, ensnaring by stealth, now stood a hunted stag--even at bay--as all perceived who watched the irrepressible changes of his
Ryland ended by moving, that any attempt to re-erect the kingly power should be declared treason, and he a traitor who should endeavour to change the present form of government.
Cheers and loud acclamations followed the close of his speech.
After his motion had been seconded, Lord Raymond rose,--his countenance bland, his voice softly melodious, his manner soothing, his grace and sweetness came like the mild breathing of a flute, after the loud, organ-like voice of his adversary.
He rose, he said, to speak in favour of the honourable member's motion, with one slight amendment subjoined.
He was ready to go back to old times, and commemorate the contests of our fathers, and the monarch's abdication.
Nobly and greatly, he said, had the illustrious and last sovereign of England sacrificed himself to the apparent good of his country, and divested himself of a power which could only be maintained by the blood of his subjects--these subjects named so no
An ample estate was allotted to them, and they took the first rank among the peers of Great Britain.
Yet it might be conjectured that they had not forgotten their ancient heritage; and it was hard that his heir should suffer alike with any other pretender, if he attempted to regain what by ancient right and inheritance belonged to him.
He did not say that he should favour such an attempt; but he did say that such an attempt would be venial; and, if the aspirant did not go so far as to declare war, and erect a standard in the kingdom, his fault ought to be regarded with an indulgent eye.
In his amendment he proposed, that an exception should be made in the bill in favour of any person who claimed the sovereign power in right of the earls of Windsor.
Nor did Raymond make an end without drawing in vivid and glowing colours, the splendour of a kingdom, in opposition to the commercial spirit of republicanism.
He asserted, that each individual under the English monarchy, was then as now, capable of attaining high rank and power--with one only exception, that of the function of chief magistrate; higher and nobler rank, than a bartering, timorous commonwealth
And for this one exception, to what did it amount?
The nature of riches and influence forcibly confined the list of candidates to a few of the wealthiest; and it was much to be feared, that the ill-humour and contention generated by this triennial struggle, would counterbalance its advantages in impartial
I can ill record the flow of language and graceful turns of expression, the wit and easy raillery that gave vigour and influence to his speech.
His manner, timid at first, became firm--his changeful face was lit up to superhuman brilliancy; his voice, various as music, was like that enchanting.
It were useless to record the debate that followed this harangue.
Party speeches were delivered, which clothed the question in cant, and veiled its simple meaning in a woven wind of words.
The motion was lost; Ryland withdrew in rage and despair; and Raymond, gay and exulting, retired to dream of his future kingdom.
CHAPTER IV.
IS there such a feeling as love at first sight?
And if there be, in what does its nature differ from love founded in long observation and slow growth?
Perhaps its effects are not so permanent; but they are, while they last, as violent and intense.
We walk the pathless mazes of society, vacant of joy, till we hold this clue, leading us through that labyrinth to paradise.
Our nature dim, like to an unlighted torch, sleeps in formless blank till the fire attain it; this life of life, this light to moon, and glory to the sun.
What does it matter, whether the fire be struck from flint and steel, nourished with care into a flame, slowly communicated to the dark wick, or whether swiftly the radiant power of light and warmth passes from a kindred power, and shines at once the
In the deepest fountain of my heart the pulses were stirred; around, above, beneath, the clinging Memory as a cloak enwrapt me.
In no one moment of coming time did I feel as I had done in time gone by.
The spirit of Idris hovered in the air I breathed; her eyes were ever and for ever bent on mine; her remembered smile blinded my faint gaze, and caused me to walk as one, not in eclipse, not in darkness and vacancy--but in a new and brilliant light, too
On every leaf, on every small division of the universe, (as on the hyacinth ai is engraved) was imprinted the talisman of my existence--SHE LIVES!
SHE IS!
--I had not time yet to analyze my feeling, to take myself to task, and leash in the tameless passion; all was one idea, one feeling, one knowledge --it was my life!
But the die was cast--Raymond would marry Idris.
The merry marriage bells rung in my ears; I heard the nation's gratulation which followed the union; the ambitious noble uprose with swift eagle-flight, from the lowly ground to regal supremacy--and to the love of Idris.
Yet, not so!
She did not love him; she had called me her friend; she had smiled on me; to me she had entrusted her heart's dearest hope, the welfare of Adrian.
This reflection thawed my congealing blood, and again the tide of life and love flowed impetuously onward, again to ebb as my busy thoughts changed.
The debate had ended at three in the morning.
My soul was in tumults; I traversed the streets with eager rapidity.
Truly, I was mad that night-- love--which I have named a giant from its birth, wrestled with despair!
My heart, the field of combat, was wounded by the iron heel of the one, watered by the gushing tears of the other.
Day, hateful to me, dawned; I retreated to my lodgings--I threw myself on a couch--I slept--was it sleep?
--for thought was still alive--love and despair struggled still, and I writhed with unendurable pain.
I awoke half stupefied; I felt a heavy oppression on me, but knew not wherefore; I entered, as it were, the council-chamber of my brain, and questioned the various ministers of thought therein assembled; too soon I remembered all; too soon my limbs
Suddenly, unannounced, Lord Raymond entered my apartment.
He came in gaily, singing the Tyrolese song of liberty; noticed me with a gracious nod, and threw himself on a sopha opposite the copy of a bust of the Apollo Belvidere.
After one or two trivial remarks, to which I sullenly replied, he suddenly cried, looking at the bust, "I am called like that victor!
Not a bad idea; the head will serve for my new coinage, and be an omen to all dutiful subjects of my future success".
He said this in his most gay, yet benevolent manner, and smiled, not disdainfully, but in playful mockery of himself.
Then his countenance suddenly darkened, and in that shrill tone peculiar to himself, he cried, "I fought a good battle last night; higher conquest the plains of Greece never saw me achieve.
Now I am the first man in the state, burthen of every ballad, and object of old women's mumbled devotions.
What are your meditations?
You, who fancy that you can read the human soul, as your native lake reads each crevice and folding of its surrounding hills--say what you think of me; king-expectant, angel or devil, which"?
This ironical tone was discord to my bursting, over-boiling-heart; I was nettled by his insolence, and replied with bitterness; "There is a spirit, neither angel or devil, damned to limbo merely".
I saw his cheeks become pale, and his lips whiten and quiver; his anger served but to enkindle mine, and I answered with a determined look his eyes which glared on me; suddenly they were withdrawn, cast down, a tear, I thought, wetted the dark lashes; I
I paused, even awed by the agitation he evinced; "Yes," he said at length, rising and biting his lip, as he strove to curb his passion; "Such am I!
You do not know me, Verney; neither you, nor our audience of last night, nor does universal England know aught of me.
I stand here, it would seem, an elected king; this hand is about to grasp a sceptre; these brows feel in each nerve the coming diadem.
I appear to have strength, power, victory; standing as a dome-supporting column stands; and I am--a reed!
I have ambition, and that attains its aim; my nightly dreams are realized, my waking hopes fulfilled; a kingdom awaits my acceptance, my enemies are overthrown.
But here," and he struck his heart with violence, "here is the rebel, here the stumbling-block; this over-ruling heart, which I may drain of its living blood; but, while one fluttering pulsation remains, I am its slave".
He spoke with a broken voice, then bowed his head, and, hiding his face in his hands, wept.
I was still smarting from my own disappointment; yet this scene oppressed me even to terror, nor could I interrupt his access of passion.
It subsided at length; and, throwing himself on the couch, he remained silent and motionless, except that his changeful features shewed a strong internal conflict.
At last he rose, and said in his usual tone of voice, "The time grows on us, Verney, I must away.
Let me not forget my chiefest errand here.
Will you accompany me to Windsor to-morrow?
You will not be dishonoured by my society, and as this is probably the last service, or disservice you can do me, will you grant my request"?
He held out his hand with almost a bashful air.
Swiftly I thought--Yes, I will witness the last scene of the drama.
Beside which, his mien conquered me, and an affectionate sentiment towards him, again filled my heart--I bade him command me.
"Aye, that I will," said he gaily, "that's my cue now; be with me to-morrow morning by seven; be secret and faithful; and you shall be groom of the stole ere long".
So saying, he hastened away, vaulted on his horse, and with a gesture as if he gave me his hand to kiss, bade me another laughing adieu.
Left to myself, I strove with painful intensity to divine the motive of his request and foresee the events of the coming day.
The hours passed on unperceived; my head ached with thought, the nerves seemed teeming with the over full fraught--I clasped my burning brow, as if my fevered hand could medicine its pain.
I was punctual to the appointed hour on the following day, and found Lord Raymond waiting for me.
We got into his carriage, and proceeded towards Windsor.
I had tutored myself, and was resolved by no outward sign to disclose my internal agitation.
"What a mistake Ryland made," said Raymond, "when he thought to overpower me the other night.
He spoke well, very well; such an harangue would have succeeded better addressed to me singly, than to the fools and knaves assembled yonder.
Had I been alone, I should have listened to him with a wish to hear reason, but when he endeavoured to vanquish me in my own territory, with my own weapons, he put me on my mettle, and the event was such as all might have expected".
I smiled incredulously, and replied: "I am of Ryland's way of thinking, and will, if you please, repeat all his arguments; we shall see how far you will be induced by them, to change the royal for the patriotic style".
"The repetition would be useless," said Raymond, "since I well remember them, and have many others, self-suggested, which speak with unanswerable persuasion".
He did not explain himself, nor did I make any remark on his reply.
Our silence endured for some miles, till the country with open fields, or shady woods and parks, presented pleasant objects to our view.
After some observations on the scenery and seats, Raymond said: "Philosophers have called man a microcosm of nature, and find a reflection in the internal mind for all this machinery visibly at work around us.
This theory has often been a source of amusement to me; and many an idle hour have I spent, exercising my ingenuity in finding resemblances.
Does not Lord Bacon say that, 'the falling from a discord to a concord, which maketh great sweetness in music, hath an agreement with the affections, which are re-integrated to the better after some dislikes?
' What a sea is the tide of passion, whose fountains are in our own nature!
Our virtues are the quick-sands, which shew themselves at calm and low water; but let the waves arise and the winds buffet them, and the poor devil whose hope was in their durability, finds them sink from under him.
The fashions of the world, its exigencies, educations and pursuits, are winds to drive our wills, like clouds all one way; but let a thunderstorm arise in the shape of love, hate, or ambition, and the rack goes backward, stemming the opposing air in
"Yet," replied I, "nature always presents to our eyes the appearance of a patient: while there is an active principle in man which is capable of ruling fortune, and at least of tacking against the gale, till it in some mode conquers it".
"There is more of what is specious than true in your distinction," said my companion.
"Did we form ourselves, choosing our dispositions, and our powers?
I find myself, for one, as a stringed instrument with chords and stops--but I have no power to turn the pegs, or pitch my thoughts to a higher or lower key".
"Other men," I observed, "may be better musicians".
"I talk not of others, but myself," replied Raymond, "and I am as fair an example to go by as another.
I cannot set my heart to a particular tune, or run voluntary changes on my will.
We are born; we choose neither our parents, nor our station; we are educated by others, or by the world's circumstance, and this cultivation, mingling with our innate disposition, is the soil in which our desires, passions, and motives grow".
"There is much truth in what you say," said I, "and yet no man ever acts upon this theory.
Who, when he makes a choice, says, Thus I choose, because I am necessitated?
Does he not on the contrary feel a freedom of will within him, which, though you may call it fallacious, still actuates him as he decides"?
"Exactly so," replied Raymond, "another link of the breakless chain.
Were I now to commit an act which would annihilate my hopes, and pluck the regal garment from my mortal limbs, to clothe them in ordinary weeds, would this, think you, be an act of free-will on my part"?
As we talked thus, I perceived that we were not going the ordinary road to Windsor, but through Englefield Green, towards Bishopgate Heath.
I began to divine that Idris was not the object of our journey, but that I was brought to witness the scene that was to decide the fate of Raymond--and of Perdita.
Raymond had evidently vacillated during his journey, and irresolution was marked in every gesture as we entered Perdita's cottage.
I watched him curiously, determined that, if this hesitation should continue, I would assist Perdita to overcome herself, and teach her to disdain the wavering love of him, who balanced between the possession of a crown, and of her, whose excellence and
We found her in her flower-adorned alcove; she was reading the newspaper report of the debate in parliament, that apparently doomed her to hopelessness.
That heart-sinking feeling was painted in her sunk eyes and spiritless attitude; a cloud was on her beauty, and frequent sighs were tokens of her distress.
This sight had an instantaneous effect on Raymond; his eyes beamed with tenderness, and remorse clothed his manners with earnestness and truth.
He sat beside her; and, taking the paper from her hand, said, "Not a word more shall my sweet Perdita read of this contention of madmen and fools.
I must not permit you to be acquainted with the extent of my delusion, lest you despise me; although, believe me, a wish to appear before you, not vanquished, but as a conqueror, inspired me during my wordy war".
Perdita looked at him like one amazed; her expressive countenance shone for a moment with tenderness; to see him only was happiness.
But a bitter thought swiftly shadowed her joy; she bent her eyes on the ground, endeavouring to master the passion of tears that threatened to overwhelm her.
Raymond continued, "I will not act a part with you, dear girl, or appear other than what I am, weak and unworthy, more fit to excite your disdain than your love.
Yet you do love me; I feel and know that you do, and thence I draw my most cherished hopes.
If pride guided you, or even reason, you might well reject me.
Do so; if your high heart, incapable of my infirmity of purpose, refuses to bend to the lowness of mine.
Turn from me, if you will,--if you can.
If your whole soul does not urge you to forgive me--if your entire heart does not open wide its door to admit me to its very centre, forsake me, never speak to me again.
I, though sinning against you almost beyond remission, I also am proud; there must be no reserve in your pardon--no drawback to the gift of your affection".
Perdita looked down, confused, yet pleased.
My presence embarrassed her; so that she dared not turn to meet her lover's eye, or trust her voice to assure him of her affection; while a blush mantled her cheek, and her disconsolate air was exchanged for one expressive of deep-felt joy.
Raymond encircled her waist with his arm, and continued, "I do not deny that I have balanced between you and the highest hope that mortal men can entertain; but I do so no longer.
Take me--mould me to your will, possess my heart and soul to all eternity.
If you refuse to contribute to my happiness, I quit England to-night, and will never set foot in it again.
"Lionel, you hear: witness for me: persuade your sister to forgive the injury I have done her; persuade her to be mine".
"There needs no persuasion," said the blushing Perdita, "except your own dear promises, and my ready heart, which whispers to me that they are true".
That same evening we all three walked together in the forest, and, with the garrulity which happiness inspires, they detailed to me the history of their loves.
It was pleasant to see the haughty Raymond and reserved Perdita changed through happy love into prattling, playful children, both losing their characteristic dignity in the fulness of mutual contentment.
A night or two ago Lord Raymond, with a brow of care, and a heart oppressed with thought, bent all his energies to silence or persuade the legislators of England that a sceptre was not too weighty for his hand, while visions of dominion, war, and triumph
I rambled away from them.
If the rapture of assured sympathy was theirs, I enjoyed that of restored hope.
I looked on the regal towers of Windsor.
High is the wall and strong the barrier that separate me from my Star of Beauty.
But not impassible.
She will not be his.
A few more years dwell in thy native garden, sweet flower, till I by toil and time acquire a right to gather thee.
Despair not, nor bid me despair!
What must I do now?
First I must seek Adrian, and restore him to her.
Patience, gentleness, and untired affection, shall recall him, if it be true, as Raymond says, that he is mad; energy and courage shall rescue him, if he be unjustly imprisoned.
After the lovers again joined me, we supped together in the alcove.
Truly it was a fairy's supper; for though the air was perfumed by the scent of fruits and wine, we none of us either ate or drank--even the beauty of the night was unobserved; their extasy could not be increased by outward objects, and I was wrapt in
At about midnight Raymond and I took leave of my sister, to return to town.
He was all gaiety; scraps of songs fell from his lips; every thought of his mind--every object about us, gleamed under the sunshine of his mirth.
He accused me of melancholy, of ill-humour and envy.
"Not so," said I, "though I confess that my thoughts are not occupied as pleasantly as yours are.
You promised to facilitate my visit to Adrian; I conjure you to perform your promise.
I cannot linger here; I long to soothe --perhaps to cure the malady of my first and best friend.
I shall immediately depart for Dunkeld".
"Thou bird of night," replied Raymond, "what an eclipse do you throw across my bright thoughts, forcing me to call to mind that melancholy ruin, which stands in mental desolation, more irreparable than a fragment of a carved column in a weed-grown field.
You dream that you can restore him?
Daedalus never wound so inextricable an error round Minotaur, as madness has woven about his imprisoned reason.
Nor you, nor any other Theseus, can thread the labyrinth, to which perhaps some unkind Ariadne has the clue".
"You allude to Evadne Zaimi: but she is not in England".
"And were she," said Raymond, "I would not advise her seeing him.
Better to decay in absolute delirium, than to be the victim of the methodical unreason of ill-bestowed love.
The long duration of his malady has probably erased from his mind all vestige of her; and it were well that it should never again be imprinted.
You will find him at Dunkeld; gentle and tractable he wanders up the hills, and through the wood, or sits listening beside the waterfall.
You may see him--his hair stuck with wild flowers --his eyes full of untraceable meaning--his voice broken--his person wasted to a shadow.
He plucks flowers and weeds, and weaves chaplets of them, or sails yellow leaves and bits of bark on the stream, rejoicing in their safety, or weeping at their wreck.
The very memory half unmans me.
By Heaven!
the first tears I have shed since boyhood rushed scalding into my eyes when I saw him".
It needed not this last account to spur me on to visit him.
I only doubted whether or not I should endeavour to see Idris again, before I departed.
This doubt was decided on the following day.
Early in the morning Raymond came to me; intelligence had arrived that Adrian was dangerously ill, and it appeared impossible that his failing strength should surmount the disorder.
"To-morrow," said Raymond, "his mother and sister set out for Scotland to see him once again".
"And I go to-day," I cried; "this very hour I will engage a sailing balloon; I shall be there in forty-eight hours at furthest, perhaps in less, if the wind is fair.
Farewell, Raymond; be happy in having chosen the better part in life.
This turn of fortune revives me.
I feared madness, not sickness--I have a presentiment that Adrian will not die; perhaps this illness is a crisis, and he may recover".
Everything favoured my journey.
The balloon rose about half a mile from the earth, and with a favourable wind it hurried through the air, its feathered vans cleaving the unopposing atmosphere.
Notwithstanding the melancholy object of my journey, my spirits were exhilarated by reviving hope, by the swift motion of the airy pinnace, and the balmy visitation of the sunny air.
The pilot hardly moved the plumed steerage, and the slender mechanism of the wings, wide unfurled, gave forth a murmuring noise, soothing to the sense.
Plain and hill, stream and corn-field, were discernible below, while we unimpeded sped on swift and secure, as a wild swan in his spring-tide flight.
The machine obeyed the slightest motion of the helm; and, the wind blowing steadily, there was no let or obstacle to our course.
Such was the power of man over the elements; a power long sought, and lately won; yet foretold in by-gone time by the prince of poets, whose verses I quoted much to the astonishment of my pilot, when I told him how many hundred years ago they had been
human wit, thou can'st invent much ill, Thou searchest strange arts: who would think by skill, An heavy man like a light bird should stray, And through the empty heavens find a way?
I alighted at Perth; and, though much fatigued by a constant exposure to the air for many hours, I would not rest, but merely altering my mode of conveyance, I went by land instead of air, to Dunkeld.
The sun was rising as I entered the opening of the hills.
After the revolution of ages Birnam hill was again covered with a young forest, while more aged pines, planted at the very commencement of the nineteenth century by the then Duke of Athol, gave solemnity and beauty to the scene.
The rising sun first tinged the pine tops; and my mind, rendered through my mountain education deeply susceptible of the graces of nature, and now on the eve of again beholding my beloved and perhaps dying friend, was strangely influenced by the sight of
Poor fellow!
he lay stretched on a bed of sickness, his cheeks glowing with the hues of fever, his eyes half closed, his breath irregular and difficult.
Yet it was less painful to see him thus, than to find him fulfilling the animal functions uninterruptedly, his mind sick the while.
I established myself at his bedside; I never quitted it day or night.
Bitter task was it, to behold his spirit waver between death and life: to see his warm cheek, and know that the very fire which burned too fiercely there, was consuming the vital fuel; to hear his moaning voice, which might never again articulate words of
Such for three days and nights appeared the consummation which fate had decreed for my labours, and I became haggard and spectre-like, through anxiety and watching.
At length his eyes unclosed faintly, yet with a look of returning life; he became pale and weak; but the rigidity of his features was softened by approaching convalescence.
He knew me.
What a brimful cup of joyful agony it was, when his face first gleamed with the glance of recognition--when he pressed my hand, now more fevered than his own, and when he pronounced my name!
No trace of his past insanity remained, to dash my joy with sorrow.
This same evening his mother and sister arrived.
The Countess of Windsor was by nature full of energetic feeling; but she had very seldom in her life permitted the concentrated emotions of her heart to shew themselves on her features.
The studied immovability of her countenance; her slow, equable manner, and soft but unmelodious voice, were a mask, hiding her fiery passions, and the impatience of her disposition.
She did not in the least resemble either of her children; her black and sparkling eye, lit up by pride, was totally unlike the blue lustre, and frank, benignant expression of either Adrian or Idris.
There was something grand and majestic in her motions, but nothing persuasive, nothing amiable.
Tall, thin, and strait, her face still handsome, her raven hair hardly tinged with grey, her forehead arched and beautiful, had not the eye-brows been somewhat scattered--it was impossible not to be struck by her, almost to fear her.
Idris appeared to be the only being who could resist her mother, notwithstanding the extreme mildness of her character.
But there was a fearlessness and frankness about her, which said that she would not encroach on another's liberty, but held her own sacred and unassailable.
The Countess cast no look of kindness on my worn-out frame, though afterwards she thanked me coldly for my attentions.
Not so Idris; her first glance was for her brother; she took his hand, she kissed his eye-lids, and hung over him with looks of compassion and love.
Her eyes glistened with tears when she thanked me, and the grace of her expressions was enhanced, not diminished, by the fervour, which caused her almost to falter as she spoke.
Her mother, all eyes and ears, soon interrupted us; and I saw, that she wished to dismiss me quietly, as one whose services, now that his relatives had arrived, were of no use to her son.
I was harassed and ill, resolved not to give up my post, yet doubting in what way I should assert it; when Adrian called me, and clasping my hand, bade me not leave him.
His mother, apparently inattentive, at once understood what was meant, and seeing the hold we had upon her, yielded the point to us.
The days that followed were full of pain to me; so that I sometimes regretted that I had not yielded at once to the haughty lady, who watched all my motions, and turned my beloved task of nursing my friend to a work of pain and irritation.
Never did any woman appear so entirely made of mind, as the Countess of Windsor.
Her passions had subdued her appetites, even her natural wants; she slept little, and hardly ate at all; her body was evidently considered by her as a mere machine, whose health was necessary for the accomplishment of her schemes, but whose senses formed
There is something fearful in one who can thus conquer the animal part of our nature, if the victory be not the effect of consummate virtue; nor was it without a mixture of this feeling, that I beheld the figure of the Countess awake when others slept,
She resolved to prevent or diminish my opportunities of acquiring influence over her children, and circumvented my plans by a hard, quiet, stubborn resolution, that seemed not to belong to flesh and blood.
War was at last tacitly acknowledged between us.
We had many pitched battles, during which no word was spoken, hardly a look was interchanged, but in which each resolved not to submit to the other.
The Countess had the advantage of position; so I was vanquished, though I would not yield.
I became sick at heart.
My countenance was painted with the hues of ill health and vexation.
Adrian and Idris saw this; they attributed it to my long watching and anxiety; they urged me to rest, and take care of myself, while I most truly assured them, that my best medicine was their good wishes; those, and the assured convalescence of my friend,
The faint rose again blushed on his cheek; his brow and lips lost the ashy paleness of threatened dissolution; such was the dear reward of my unremitting attention--and bounteous heaven added overflowing recompence, when it gave me also the thanks and
After the lapse of a few weeks, we left Dunkeld.
Idris and her mother returned immediately to Windsor, while Adrian and I followed by slow journies and frequent stoppages, occasioned by his continued weakness.
As we traversed the various counties of fertile England, all wore an exhilarating appearance to my companion, who had been so long secluded by disease from the enjoyments of weather and scenery.
We passed through busy towns and cultivated plains.
The husbandmen were getting in their plenteous harvests, and the women and children, occupied by light rustic toils, formed groupes of happy, healthful persons, the very sight of whom carried cheerfulness to the heart.
One evening, quitting our inn, we strolled down a shady lane, then up a grassy slope, till we came to an eminence, that commanded an extensive view of hill and dale, meandering rivers, dark woods, and shining villages.
The sun was setting; and the clouds, straying, like new-shorn sheep, through the vast fields of sky, received the golden colour of his parting beams; the distant uplands shone out, and the busy hum of evening came, harmonized by distance, on our ear.
Adrian, who felt all the fresh spirit infused by returning health, clasped his hands in delight, and exclaimed with transport: "O happy earth, and happy inhabitants of earth!
A stately palace has God built for you, O man!
and worthy are you of your dwelling!
Behold the verdant carpet spread at our feet, and the azure canopy above; the fields of earth which generate and nurture all things, and the track of heaven, which contains and clasps all things.
Now, at this evening hour, at the period of repose and refection, methinks all hearts breathe one hymn of love and thanksgiving, and we, like priests of old on the mountain-tops, give a voice to their sentiment.
"Assuredly a most benignant power built up the majestic fabric we inhabit, and framed the laws by which it endures.
If mere existence, and not happiness, had been the final end of our being, what need of the profuse luxuries which we enjoy?
Why should our dwelling place be so lovely, and why should the instincts of nature minister pleasurable sensations?
The very sustaining of our animal machine is made delightful; and our sustenance, the fruits of the field, is painted with transcendant hues, endued with grateful odours, and palatable to our taste.
Why should this be, if HE were not good?
We need houses to protect us from the seasons, and behold the materials with which we are provided; the growth of trees with their adornment of leaves; while rocks of stone piled above the plains variegate the prospect with their pleasant irregularity.
"Nor are outward objects alone the receptacles of the Spirit of Good.
Look into the mind of man, where wisdom reigns enthroned; where imagination, the painter, sits, with his pencil dipt in hues lovelier than those of sunset, adorning familiar life with glowing tints.
What a noble boon, worthy the giver, is the imagination!
it takes from reality its leaden hue: it envelopes all thought and sensation in a radiant veil, and with an hand of beauty beckons us from the sterile seas of life, to her gardens, and bowers, and glades of bliss.
And is not love a gift of the divinity?
Love, and her child, Hope, which can bestow wealth on poverty, strength on the weak, and happiness on the sorrowing.
"My lot has not been fortunate.
I have consorted long with grief, entered the gloomy labyrinth of madness, and emerged, but half alive.
Yet I thank God that I have lived!
I thank God, that I have beheld his throne, the heavens, and earth, his footstool.
I am glad that I have seen the changes of his day; to behold the sun, fountain of light, and the gentle pilgrim moon; to have seen the fire bearing flowers of the sky, and the flowery stars of earth; to have witnessed the sowing and the harvest.
I am glad that I have loved, and have experienced sympathetic joy and sorrow with my fellow-creatures.
I am glad now to feel the current of thought flow through my mind, as the blood through the articulations of my frame; mere existence is pleasure; and I thank God that I live!
"And all ye happy nurslings of mother-earth, do ye not echo my words?
Ye who are linked by the affectionate ties of nature, companions, friends, lovers!
fathers, who toil with joy for their offspring; women, who while gazing on the living forms of their children, forget the pains of maternity; children, who neither toil nor spin, but love and are loved!
"Oh, that death and sickness were banished from our earthly home!
that hatred, tyranny, and fear could no longer make their lair in the human heart!
that each man might find a brother in his fellow, and a nest of repose amid the wide plains of his inheritance!
that the source of tears were dry, and that lips might no longer form expressions of sorrow.
Sleeping thus under the beneficent eye of heaven, can evil visit thee, O Earth, or grief cradle to their graves thy luckless children?
Whisper it not, let the demons hear and rejoice!
The choice is with us; let us will it, and our habitation becomes a paradise.
For the will of man is omnipotent, blunting the arrows of death, soothing the bed of disease, and wiping away the tears of agony.
And what is each human being worth, if he do not put forth his strength to aid his fellow-creatures?
My soul is a fading spark, my nature frail as a spent wave; but I dedicate all of intellect and strength that remains to me, to that one work, and take upon me the task, as far as I am able, of bestowing blessings on my fellow-men"!
His voice trembled, his eyes were cast up, his hands clasped, and his fragile person was bent, as it were, with excess of emotion.
The spirit of life seemed to linger in his form, as a dying flame on an altar flickers on the embers of an accepted sacrifice.
CHAPTER V. WHEN we arrived at Windsor, I found that Raymond and Perdita had departed for the continent.
I took possession of my sister's cottage, and blessed myself that I lived within view of Windsor Castle.
It was a curious fact, that at this period, when by the marriage of Perdita I was allied to one of the richest individuals in England, and was bound by the most intimate friendship to its chiefest noble, I experienced the greatest excess of poverty that I
My knowledge of the worldly principles of Lord Raymond, would have ever prevented me from applying to him, however deep my distress might have been.
It was in vain that I repeated to myself with regard to Adrian, that his purse was open to me; that one in soul, as we were, our fortunes ought also to be common.
I could never, while with him, think of his bounty as a remedy to my poverty; and I even put aside hastily his offers of supplies, assuring him of a falsehood, that I needed them not.
How could I say to this generous being, "Maintain me in idleness.
You who have dedicated your powers of mind and fortune to the benefit of your species, shall you so misdirect your exertions, as to support in uselessness the strong, healthy, and capable"?
And yet I dared not request him to use his influence that I might obtain an honourable provision for myself--for then I should have been obliged to leave Windsor.
I hovered for ever around the walls of its Castle, beneath its enshadowing thickets; my sole companions were my books and my loving thoughts.
I studied the wisdom of the ancients, and gazed on the happy walls that sheltered the beloved of my soul.
My mind was nevertheless idle.
I pored over the poetry of old times; I studied the metaphysics of Plato and Berkeley.
I read the histories of Greece and Rome, and of England's former periods, and I watched the movements of the lady of my heart.
At night I could see her shadow on the walls of her apartment; by day I viewed her in her flower-garden, or riding in the park with her usual companions.
Methought the charm would be broken if I were seen, but I heard the music of her voice and was happy.
I gave to each heroine of whom I read, her beauty and matchless excellences--such was Antigone, when she guided the blind Oedipus to the grove of the Eumenides, and discharged the funeral rites of Polynices; such was Miranda in the unvisited cave of
I was mad with excess of passionate devotion; but pride, tameless as fire, invested my nature, and prevented me from betraying myself by word or look.
In the mean time, while I thus pampered myself with rich mental repasts, a peasant would have disdained my scanty fare, which I sometimes robbed from the squirrels of the forest.
I was, I own, often tempted to recur to the lawless feats of my boy-hood, and knock down the almost tame pheasants that perched upon the trees, and bent their bright eyes on me.
But they were the property of Adrian, the nurslings of Idris; and so, although my imagination rendered sensual by privation, made me think that they would better become the spit in my kitchen, than the green leaves of the forest, Nathelesse, I checked my
But, at this period, the whole scheme of my existence was about to change.
The orphan and neglected son of Verney, was on the eve of being linked to the mechanism of society by a golden chain, and to enter into all the duties and affections of life.
Miracles were to be wrought in my favour, the machine of social life pushed with vast effort backward.
Attend, O reader!
while I narrate this tale of wonders!
One day as Adrian and Idris were riding through the forest, with their mother and accustomed companions, Idris, drawing her brother aside from the rest of the cavalcade, suddenly asked him, "What had become of his friend, Lionel Verney"?
"Even from this spot," replied Adrian, pointing to my sister's cottage, "you can see his dwelling".
"Indeed"!
said Idris, "and why, if he be so near, does he not come to see us, and make one of our society"?
"I often visit him," replied Adrian; "but you may easily guess the motives, which prevent him from coming where his presence may annoy any one among us".
"I do guess them," said Idris, "and such as they are, I would not venture to combat them.
Tell me, however, in what way he passes his time; what he is doing and thinking in his cottage retreat"?
"Nay, my sweet sister," replied Adrian, "you ask me more than I can well answer; but if you feel interest in him, why not visit him?
He will feel highly honoured, and thus you may repay a part of the obligation I owe him, and compensate for the injuries fortune has done him".
"I will most readily accompany you to his abode," said the lady, "not that I wish that either of us should unburthen ourselves of our debt, which, being no less than your life, must remain unpayable ever.
But let us go; to-morrow we will arrange to ride out together, and proceeding towards that part of the forest, call upon him".
The next evening therefore, though the autumnal change had brought on cold and rain, Adrian and Idris entered my cottage.
They found me Curius-like, feasting on sorry fruits for supper; but they brought gifts richer than the golden bribes of the Sabines, nor could I refuse the invaluable store of friendship and delight which they bestowed.
Surely the glorious twins of Latona were not more welcome, when, in the infancy of the world, they were brought forth to beautify and enlighten this "sterile promontory," than were this angelic pair to my lowly dwelling and grateful heart.
We sat like one family round my hearth.
Our talk was on subjects, unconnected with the emotions that evidently occupied each; but we each divined the other's thought, and as our voices spoke of indifferent matters, our eyes, in mute language, told a thousand things no tongue could have uttered.
They left me in an hour's time.
They left me happy--how unspeakably happy.
It did not require the measured sounds of human language to syllable the story of my extasy.
Idris had visited me; Idris I should again and again see--my imagination did not wander beyond the completeness of this knowledge.
I trod air; no doubt, no fear, no hope even, disturbed me; I clasped with my soul the fulness of contentment, satisfied, undesiring, beatified.
For many days Adrian and Idris continued to visit me thus.
In this dear intercourse, love, in the guise of enthusiastic friendship, infused more and more of his omnipotent spirit.
Idris felt it.
Yes, divinity of the world, I read your characters in her looks and gesture; I heard your melodious voice echoed by her--you prepared for us a soft and flowery path, all gentle thoughts adorned it--your name, O Love, was not spoken, but you stood the
Organs of articulate sound did not proclaim the union of our hearts; for untoward circumstance allowed no opportunity for the expression that hovered on our lips.
Oh my pen!
haste thou to write what was, before the thought of what is, arrests the hand that guides thee.
If I lift up my eyes and see the desart earth, and feel that those dear eyes have spent their mortal lustre, and that those beauteous lips are silent, their "crimson leaves" faded, for ever I am mute!
But you live, my Idris, even now you move before me!
There was a glade, O reader!
a grassy opening in the wood; the retiring trees left its velvet expanse as a temple for love; the silver Thames bounded it on one side, and a willow bending down dipt in the water its Naiad hair, dishevelled by the wind's viewless hand.
The oaks around were the home of a tribe of nightingales--there am I now; Idris, in youth's dear prime, is by my side --remember, I am just twenty-two, and seventeen summers have scarcely passed over the beloved of my heart.
The river swollen by autumnal rains, deluged the low lands, and Adrian in his favourite boat is employed in the dangerous pastime of plucking the topmost bough from a submerged oak.
Are you weary of life, O Adrian, that you thus play with danger?
-- He has obtained his prize, and he pilots his boat through the flood; our eyes were fixed on him fearfully, but the stream carried him away from us; he was forced to land far lower down, and to make a considerable circuit before he could join us.
"He is safe"!
said Idris, as he leapt on shore, and waved the bough over his head in token of success; "we will wait for him here".
We were alone together; the sun had set; the song of the nightingales began; the evening star shone distinct in the flood of light, which was yet unfaded in the west.
The blue eyes of my angelic girl were fixed on this sweet emblem of herself: "How the light palpitates," she said, "which is that star's life.
Its vacillating effulgence seems to say that its state, even like ours upon earth, is wavering and inconstant; it fears, methinks, and it loves".
"Gaze not on the star, dear, generous friend," I cried, "read not love in its trembling rays; look not upon distant worlds; speak not of the mere imagination of a sentiment.
I have long been silent; long even to sickness have I desired to speak to you, and submit my soul, my life, my entire being to you.
Look not on the star, dear love, or do, and let that eternal spark plead for me; let it be my witness and my advocate, silent as it shines--love is to me as light to the star; even so long as that is uneclipsed by annihilation, so long shall I love you".
Veiled for ever to the world's callous eye must be the transport of that moment.
Still do I feel her graceful form press against my full-fraught heart--still does sight, and pulse, and breath sicken and fail, at the remembrance of that first kiss.
Slowly and silently we went to meet Adrian, whom we heard approaching.
I entreated Adrian to return to me after he had conducted his sister home.
And that same evening, walking among the moon-lit forest paths, I poured forth my whole heart, its transport and its hope, to my friend.
For a moment he looked disturbed--"I might have foreseen this," he said, "what strife will now ensue!
Pardon me, Lionel, nor wonder that the expectation of contest with my mother should jar me, when else I should delightedly confess that my best hopes are fulfilled, in confiding my sister to your protection.
If you do not already know it, you will soon learn the deep hate my mother bears to the name Verney.
I will converse with Idris; then all that a friend can do, I will do; to her it must belong to play the lover's part, if she be capable of it".
While the brother and sister were still hesitating in what manner they could best attempt to bring their mother over to their party, she, suspecting our meetings, taxed her children with them; taxed her fair daughter with deceit, and an unbecoming
The eyes of Idris flashed at this accusation; she replied, "I do not deny that I love Verney; prove to me that he is worthless; and I will never see him more".
"Dear Madam," said Adrian, "let me entreat you to see him, to cultivate his friendship.
You will wonder then, as I do, at the extent of his accomplishments, and the brilliancy of his talents".
(Pardon me, gentle reader, this is not futile vanity;--not futile, since to know that Adrian felt thus, brings joy even now to my lone heart).
"Mad and foolish boy"!
exclaimed the angry lady, "you have chosen with dreams and theories to overthrow my schemes for your own aggrandizement; but you shall not do the same by those I have formed for your sister.
I but too well understand the fascination you both labour under; since I had the same struggle with your father, to make him cast off the parent of this youth, who hid his evil propensities with the smoothness and subtlety of a viper.
In those days how often did I hear of his attractions, his wide spread conquests, his wit, his refined manners.
It is well when flies only are caught by such spiders' webs; but is it for the high-born and powerful to bow their necks to the flimsy yoke of these unmeaning pretensions?
Were your sister indeed the insignificant person she deserves to be, I would willingly leave her to the fate, the wretched fate, of the wife of a man, whose very person, resembling as it does his wretched father, ought to remind you of the folly and vice
Are you then a fit mate for an uneducated shepherd-boy, whose only inheritance is his father's tarnished name"?
"I can make but one defence," replied Idris, "the same offered by my brother; see Lionel, converse with my shepherd-boy"---The Countess interrupted her indignantly--"Yours"!
--she cried: and then, smoothing her impassioned features to a disdainful smile, she continued--"We will talk of this another time.
All I now ask, all your mother, Idris, requests is, that you will not see this upstart during the interval of one month".
"I dare not comply," said Idris, "it would pain him too much.
I have no right to play with his feelings, to accept his proffered love, and then sting him with neglect".
"This is going too far," her mother answered, with quivering lips, and eyes again instinct by anger.
"Nay, Madam," said Adrian, "unless my sister consent never to see him again, it is surely an useless torment to separate them for a month".
"Certainly," replied the ex-queen, with bitter scorn, "his love, and her love, and both their childish flutterings, are to be put in fit comparison with my years of hope and anxiety, with the duties of the offspring of kings, with the high and dignified
But it is unworthy of me to argue and complain.
Perhaps you will have the goodness to promise me not to marry during that interval"?
This was asked only half ironically; and Idris wondered why her mother should extort from her a solemn vow not to do, what she had never dreamed of doing--but the promise was required and given.
All went on cheerfully now; we met as usual, and talked without dread of our future plans.
The Countess was so gentle, and even beyond her wont, amiable with her children, that they began to entertain hopes of her ultimate consent.
She was too unlike them, too utterly alien to their tastes, for them to find delight in her society, or in the prospect of its continuance, but it gave them pleasure to see her conciliating and kind.
Once even, Adrian ventured to propose her receiving me.
She refused with a smile, reminding him that for the present his sister had promised to be patient.
One day, after the lapse of nearly a month, Adrian received a letter from a friend in London, requesting his immediate presence for the furtherance of some important object.
Guileless himself, Adrian feared no deceit.
I rode with him as far as Staines: he was in high spirits; and, since I could not see Idris during his absence, he promised a speedy return.
His gaiety, which was extreme, had the strange effect of awakening in me contrary feelings; a presentiment of evil hung over me; I loitered on my return; I counted the hours that must elapse before I saw Idris again.
Wherefore should this be?
What evil might not happen in the mean time?
Might not her mother take advantage of Adrian's absence to urge her beyond her sufferance, perhaps to entrap her?
I resolved, let what would befall, to see and converse with her the following day.
This determination soothed me.
To-morrow, loveliest and best, hope and joy of my life, to-morrow I will see thee--Fool, to dream of a moment's delay!
I went to rest.
At past midnight I was awaked by a violent knocking.
It was now deep winter; it had snowed, and was still snowing; the wind whistled in the leafless trees, despoiling them of the white flakes as they fell; its drear moaning, and the continued knocking, mingled wildly with my dreams-- at length I was wide
Pale as the snow that showered about her, with clasped hands, Idris stood before me.
"Save me"!
she exclaimed, and would have sunk to the ground had I not supported her.
In a moment however she revived, and, with energy, almost with violence, entreated me to saddle horses, to take her away, away to London--to her brother--at least to save her.
I had no horses--she wrung her hands.
"What can I do"?
she cried, "I am lost--we are both for ever lost!
But come--come with me, Lionel; here I must not stay,--we can get a chaise at the nearest post-house; yet perhaps we have time!
come, O come with me to save and protect me"!
When I heard her piteous demands, while with disordered dress, dishevelled hair, and aghast looks, she wrung her hands--the idea shot across me is she also mad?
--"Sweet one," and I folded her to my heart, "better repose than wander further;--rest--my beloved, I will make a fire--you are chill".
"Rest"!
she cried, "repose!
you rave, Lionel!
If you delay we are lost; come, I pray you, unless you would cast me off for ever".
That Idris, the princely born, nursling of wealth and luxury, should have come through the tempestuous winter-night from her regal abode, and standing at my lowly door, conjure me to fly with her through darkness and storm--was surely a dream--again her
Looking timidly around, as if she feared to be overheard, she whispered: "I have discovered--to-morrow --that is, to-day--already the to-morrow is come--before dawn, foreigners, Austrians, my mother's hirelings, are to carry me off to Germany, to prison,
I was frightened by her vehemence, and imagined some mistake in her incoherent tale; but I no longer hesitated to obey her.
She had come by herself from the Castle, three long miles, at midnight, through the heavy snow; we must reach Englefield Green, a mile and a half further, before we could obtain a chaise.
She told me, that she had kept up her strength and courage till her arrival at my cottage, and then both failed.
Now she could hardly walk.
Supporting her as I did, still she lagged: and at the distance of half a mile, after many stoppages, shivering fits, and half faintings, she slipt from my supporting arm on the snow, and with a torrent of tears averred that she must be taken, for that she
I lifted her up in my arms; her light form rested on my breast.
--I felt no burthen, except the internal one of contrary and contending emotions.
Brimming delight now invested me.
Again her chill limbs touched me as a torpedo; and I shuddered in sympathy with her pain and fright.
Her head lay on my shoulder, her breath waved my hair, her heart beat near mine, transport made me tremble, blinded me, annihilated me--till a suppressed groan, bursting from her lips, the chattering of her teeth, which she strove vainly to subdue, and all
At last I said to her, "There is Englefield Green; there the inn.
But, if you are seen thus strangely circumstanced, dear Idris, even now your enemies may learn your flight too soon: were it not better that I hired the chaise alone?
I will put you in safety meanwhile, and return to you immediately".
She answered that I was right, and might do with her as I pleased.
I observed the door of a small out-house a-jar.
I pushed it open; and, with some hay strewed about, I formed a couch for her, placing her exhausted frame on it, and covering her with my cloak.
I feared to leave her, she looked so wan and faint--but in a moment she re-acquired animation, and, with that, fear; and again she implored me not to delay.
To call up the people of the inn, and obtain a conveyance and horses, even though I harnessed them myself, was the work of many minutes; minutes, each freighted with the weight of ages.
I caused the chaise to advance a little, waited till the people of the inn had retired, and then made the post-boy draw up the carriage to the spot where Idris, impatient, and now somewhat recovered, stood waiting for me.
I lifted her into the chaise; I assured her that with our four horses we should arrive in London before five o'clock, the hour when she would be sought and missed.
I besought her to calm herself; a kindly shower of tears relieved her, and by degrees she related her tale of fear and peril.
That same night after Adrian's departure, her mother had warmly expostulated with her on the subject of her attachment to me.
Every motive, every threat, every angry taunt was urged in vain.
She seemed to consider that through me she had lost Raymond; I was the evil influence of her life; I was even accused of encreasing and confirming the mad and base apostacy of Adrian from all views of advancement and grandeur; and now this miserable
Never, Idris related, did the angry lady deign to recur to gentleness and persuasion; if she had, the task of resistance would have been exquisitely painful.
As it was, the sweet girl's generous nature was roused to defend, and ally herself with, my despised cause.
Her mother ended with a look of contempt and covert triumph, which for a moment awakened the suspicions of Idris.
When they parted for the night, the Countess said, "To-morrow I trust your tone will be changed: be composed; I have agitated you; go to rest; and I will send you a medicine I always take when unduly restless--it will give you a quiet night".
By the time that she had with uneasy thoughts laid her fair cheek upon her pillow, her mother's servant brought a draught; a suspicion again crossed her at this novel proceeding, sufficiently alarming to determine her not to take the potion; but dislike of
Then, agitated as she had been by her mother's violence, and now by unaccustomed fears, she lay unable to sleep, starting at every sound.
Soon her door opened softly, and on her springing up, she heard a whisper, "Not asleep yet," and the door again closed.
With a beating heart she expected another visit, and when after an interval her chamber was again invaded, having first assured herself that the intruders were her mother and an attendant, she composed herself to feigned sleep.
A step approached her bed, she dared not move, she strove to calm her palpitations, which became more violent, when she heard her mother say mutteringly, "Pretty simpleton, little do you think that your game is already at an end for ever".
For a moment the poor girl fancied that her mother believed that she had drank poison: she was on the point of springing up; when the Countess, already at a distance from the bed, spoke in a low voice to her companion, and again Idris listened: "Hasten,"
The servant obeyed; few words were spoken on either side; but those were caught at with avidity by the intended victim.
She heard the name of her own maid mentioned;--"No, no," replied her mother, "she does not go with us; Lady Idris must forget England, and all belonging to it".
And again she heard, "She will not wake till late to-morrow, and we shall then be at sea".
----"All is ready," at length the woman announced.
The Countess again came to her daughter's bedside: "In Austria at least," she said, "you will obey.
In Austria, where obedience can be enforced, and no choice left but between an honourable prison and a fitting marriage".
Both then withdrew; though, as she went, the Countess said, "Softly; all sleep; though all have not been prepared for sleep, like her.
I would not have any one suspect, or she might be roused to resistance, and perhaps escape.
Come with me to my room; we will remain there till the hour agreed upon".
They went.
Idris, panic-struck, but animated and strengthened even by her excessive fear, dressed herself hurriedly, and going down a flight of back-stairs, avoiding the vicinity of her mother's apartment, she contrived to escape from the castle by a low window, and
I comforted her as well as I might.
Joy and exultation, were mine, to possess, and to save her.
Yet not to excite fresh agitation in her, "per non turbar quel bel viso sereno," I curbed my delight.
I strove to quiet the eager dancing of my heart; I turned from her my eyes, beaming with too much tenderness, and proudly, to dark night, and the inclement atmosphere, murmured the expressions of my transport.
We reached London, methought, all too soon; and yet I could not regret our speedy arrival, when I witnessed the extasy with which my beloved girl found herself in her brother's arms, safe from every evil, under his unblamed protection.
Adrian wrote a brief note to his mother, informing her that Idris was under his care and guardianship.
Several days elapsed, and at last an answer came, dated from Cologne.
"It was useless," the haughty and disappointed lady wrote, "for the Earl of Windsor and his sister to address again the injured parent, whose only expectation of tranquillity must be derived from oblivion of their existence.
Her desires had been blasted, her schemes overthrown.
She did not complain; in her brother's court she would find, not compensation for their disobedience (filial unkindness admitted of none), but such a state of things and mode of life, as might best reconcile her to her fate.
Under such circumstances, she positively declined any communication with them".
Such were the strange and incredible events, that finally brought about my union with the sister of my best friend, with my adored Idris.
With simplicity and courage she set aside the prejudices and opposition which were obstacles to my happiness, nor scrupled to give her hand, where she had given her heart.
To be worthy of her, to raise myself to her height through the exertion of talents and virtue, to repay her love with devoted, unwearied tenderness, were the only thanks I could offer for the matchless gift.
CHAPTER VI.
AND now let the reader, passing over some short period of time, be introduced to our happy circle.
Adrian, Idris and I, were established in Windsor Castle; Lord Raymond and my sister, inhabited a house which the former had built on the borders of the Great Park, near Perdita's cottage, as was still named the low-roofed abode, where we two, poor even in
We had our separate occupations and our common amusements.
Sometimes we passed whole days under the leafy covert of the forest with our books and music.
This occurred during those rare days in this country, when the sun mounts his etherial throne in unclouded majesty, and the windless atmosphere is as a bath of pellucid and grateful water, wrapping the senses in tranquillity.
When the clouds veiled the sky, and the wind scattered them there and here, rending their woof, and strewing its fragments through the aerial plains--then we rode out, and sought new spots of beauty and repose.
When the frequent rains shut us within doors, evening recreation followed morning study, ushered in by music and song.
Idris had a natural musical talent; and her voice, which had been carefully cultivated, was full and sweet.
Raymond and I made a part of the concert, and Adrian and Perdita were devout listeners.
Then we were as gay as summer insects, playful as children; we ever met one another with smiles, and read content and joy in each other's countenances.
Our prime festivals were held in Perdita's cottage; nor were we ever weary of talking of the past or dreaming of the future.
Jealousy and disquiet were unknown among us; nor did a fear or hope of change ever disturb our tranquillity.
Others said, We might be happy--we said--We are.
When any separation took place between us, it generally so happened, that Idris and Perdita would ramble away together, and we remained to discuss the affairs of nations, and the philosophy of life.
The very difference of our dispositions gave zest to these conversations.
Adrian had the superiority in learning and eloquence; but Raymond possessed a quick penetration, and a practical knowledge of life, which usually displayed itself in opposition to Adrian, and thus kept up the ball of discussion.
At other times we made excursions of many days' duration, and crossed the country to visit any spot noted for beauty or historical association.
Sometimes we went up to London, and entered into the amusements of the busy throng; sometimes our retreat was invaded by visitors from among them.
This change made us only the more sensible to the delights of the intimate intercourse of our own circle, the tranquillity of our divine forest, and our happy evenings in the halls of our beloved Castle.
The disposition of Idris was peculiarly frank, soft, and affectionate.
Her temper was unalterably sweet; and although firm and resolute on any point that touched her heart, she was yielding to those she loved.
The nature of Perdita was less perfect; but tenderness and happiness improved her temper, and softened her natural reserve.
Her understanding was clear and comprehensive, her imagination vivid; she was sincere, generous, and reasonable.
Adrian, the matchless brother of my soul, the sensitive and excellent Adrian, loving all, and beloved by all, yet seemed destined not to find the half of himself, which was to complete his happiness.
He often left us, and wandered by himself in the woods, or sailed in his little skiff, his books his only companions.
He was often the gayest of our party, at the same time that he was the only one visited by fits of despondency; his slender frame seemed overcharged with the weight of life, and his soul appeared rather to inhabit his body than unite with it.
I was hardly more devoted to my Idris than to her brother, and she loved him as her teacher, her friend, the benefactor who had secured to her the fulfilment of her dearest wishes.
Raymond, the ambitious, restless Raymond, reposed midway on the great high-road of life, and was content to give up all his schemes of sovereignty and fame, to make one of us, the flowers of the field.
His kingdom was the heart of Perdita, his subjects her thoughts; by her he was loved, respected as a superior being, obeyed, waited on.
No office, no devotion, no watching was irksome to her, as it regarded him.
She would sit apart from us and watch him; she would weep for joy to think that he was hers.
She erected a temple for him in the depth of her being, and each faculty was a priestess vowed to his service.
Sometimes she might be wayward and capricious; but her repentance was bitter, her return entire, and even this inequality of temper suited him who was not formed by nature to float idly down the stream of life.
During the first year of their marriage, Perdita presented Raymond with a lovely girl.
It was curious to trace in this miniature model the very traits of its father.
The same half-disdainful lips and smile of triumph, the same intelligent eyes, the same brow and chestnut hair; her very hands and taper fingers resembled his.
How very dear she was to Perdita!
In progress of time, I also became a father, and our little darlings, our playthings and delights, called forth a thousand new and delicious feelings.
Years passed thus,--even years.
Each month brought forth its successor, each year one like to that gone by; truly, our lives were a living comment on that beautiful sentiment of Plutarch, that "our souls have a natural inclination to love, being born as much to love, as to feel, to
We talked of change and active pursuits, but still remained at Windsor, incapable of violating the charm that attached us to our secluded life.
Pareamo aver qui tutto il ben raccolto Che fra mortali in piu parte si rimembra.
Now also that our children gave us occupation, we found excuses for our idleness, in the idea of bringing them up to a more splendid career.
At length our tranquillity was disturbed, and the course of events, which for five years had flowed on in hushing tranquillity, was broken by breakers and obstacles, that woke us from our pleasant dream.
A new Lord Protector of England was to be chosen; and, at Raymond's request, we removed to London, to witness, and even take a part in the election.
If Raymond had been united to Idris, this post had been his stepping-stone to higher dignity; and his desire for power and fame had been crowned with fullest measure.
He had exchanged a sceptre for a lute, a kingdom for Perdita.
Did he think of this as we journeyed up to town?
I watched him, but could make but little of him.
He was particularly gay, playing with his child, and turning to sport every word that was uttered.
Perhaps he did this because he saw a cloud upon Perdita's brow.
She tried to rouse herself, but her eyes every now and then filled with tears, and she looked wistfully on Raymond and her girl, as if fearful that some evil would betide them.
And so she felt.
A presentiment of ill hung over her.
She leaned from the window looking on the forest, and the turrets of the Castle, and as these became hid by intervening objects, she passionately exclaimed--"Scenes of happiness!
scenes sacred to devoted love, when shall I see you again!
and when I see ye, shall I be still the beloved and joyous Perdita, or shall I, heart-broken and lost, wander among your groves, the ghost of what I am"!
"Why, silly one," cried Raymond, "what is your little head pondering upon, that of a sudden you have become so sublimely dismal?
Cheer up, or I shall make you over to Idris, and call Adrian into the carriage, who, I see by his gesture, sympathizes with my good spirits".
Adrian was on horseback; he rode up to the carriage, and his gaiety, in addition to that of Raymond, dispelled my sister's melancholy.
We entered London in the evening, and went to our several abodes near Hyde Park.
The following morning Lord Raymond visited me early.
"I come to you," he said, "only half assured that you will assist me in my project, but resolved to go through with it, whether you concur with me or not.
Promise me secrecy however; for if you will not contribute to my success, at least you must not baffle me".
"Well, I promise.
And now---" "And now, my dear fellow, for what are we come to London?
To be present at the election of a Protector, and to give our yea or nay for his shuffling Grace of----?
or for that noisy Ryland?
Do you believe, Verney, that I brought you to town for that?
No, we will have a Protector of our own.
We will set up a candidate, and ensure his success.
We will nominate Adrian, and do our best to bestow on him the power to which he is entitled by his birth, and which he merits through his virtues.
"Do not answer; I know all your objections, and will reply to them in order.
First, Whether he will or will not consent to become a great man?
Leave the task of persuasion on that point to me; I do not ask you to assist me there.
Secondly, Whether he ought to exchange his employment of plucking blackberries, and nursing wounded partridges in the forest, for the command of a nation?
My dear Lionel, we are married men, and find employment sufficient in amusing our wives, and dancing our children.
But Adrian is alone, wifeless, childless, unoccupied.
I have long observed him.
He pines for want of some interest in life.
His heart, exhausted by his early sufferings, reposes like a new-healed limb, and shrinks from all excitement.
But his understanding, his charity, his virtues, want a field for exercise and display; and we will procure it for him.
Besides, is it not a shame, that the genius of Adrian should fade from the earth like a flower in an untrod mountain-path, fruitless?
Do you think Nature composed his surpassing machine for no purpose?
Believe me, he was destined to be the author of infinite good to his native England.
Has she not bestowed on him every gift in prodigality?
--birth, wealth, talent, goodness?
Does not every one love and admire him?
and does he not delight singly in such efforts as manifest his love to all?
Come, I see that you are already persuaded, and will second me when I propose him to-night in parliament".
"You have got up all your arguments in excellent order," I replied; "and, if Adrian consent, they are unanswerable.
One only condition I would make, --that you do nothing without his concurrence".
"I believe you are in the right," said Raymond; "although I had thought at first to arrange the affair differently.
Be it so.
I will go instantly to Adrian; and, if he inclines to consent, you will not destroy my labour by persuading him to return, and turn squirrel again in Windsor Forest.
Idris, you will not act the traitor towards me"?
"Trust me," replied she, "I will preserve a strict neutrality".
"For my part," said I, "I am too well convinced of the worth of our friend, and the rich harvest of benefits that all England would reap from his Protectorship, to deprive my countrymen of such a blessing, if he consent to bestow it on them".
In the evening Adrian visited us.
--"Do you cabal also against me," said he, laughing; "and will you make common cause with Raymond, in dragging a poor visionary from the clouds to surround him with the fire-works and blasts of earthly grandeur, instead of heavenly rays and airs?
I thought you knew me better".
"I do know you better," I replied "than to think that you would be happy in such a situation; but the good you would do to others may be an inducement, since the time is probably arrived when you can put your theories into practice, and you may bring about
"You speak of an almost-forgotten dream," said Adrian, his countenance slightly clouding as he spoke; "the visions of my boyhood have long since faded in the light of reality; I know now that I am not a man fitted to govern nations; sufficient for me, if I
"But do not you see, Lionel, the drift of our noble friend; a drift, perhaps, unknown to himself, but apparent to me.
Lord Raymond was never born to be a drone in the hive, and to find content in our pastoral life.
He thinks, that he ought to be satisfied; he imagines, that his present situation precludes the possibility of aggrandisement; he does not therefore, even in his own heart, plan change for himself.
But do you not see, that, under the idea of exalting me, he is chalking out a new path for himself; a path of action from which he has long wandered?
"Let us assist him.
He, the noble, the warlike, the great in every quality that can adorn the mind and person of man; he is fitted to be the Protector of England.
If I--that is, if we propose him, he will assuredly be elected, and will find, in the functions of that high office, scope for the towering powers of his mind.
Even Perdita will rejoice.
Perdita, in whom ambition was a covered fire until she married Raymond, which event was for a time the fulfilment of her hopes; Perdita will rejoice in the glory and advancement of her lord--and, coyly and prettily, not be discontented with her share.
In the mean time, we, the wise of the land, will return to our Castle, and, Cincinnatus-like, take to our usual labours, until our friend shall require our presence and assistance here".
The more Adrian reasoned upon this scheme, the more feasible it appeared.
His own determination never to enter into public life was insurmountable, and the delicacy of his health was a sufficient argument against it.
The next step was to induce Raymond to confess his secret wishes for dignity and fame.
He entered while we were speaking.
The way in which Adrian had received his project for setting him up as a candidate for the Protectorship, and his replies, had already awakened in his mind, the view of the subject which we were now discussing.
His countenance and manner betrayed irresolution and anxiety; but the anxiety arose from a fear that we should not prosecute, or not succeed in our idea; and his irresolution, from a doubt whether we should risk a defeat.
A few words from us decided him, and hope and joy sparkled in his eyes; the idea of embarking in a career, so congenial to his early habits and cherished wishes, made him as before energetic and bold.
We discussed his chances, the merits of the other candidates, and the dispositions of the voters.
After all we miscalculated.
Raymond had lost much of his popularity, and was deserted by his peculiar partizans.
Absence from the busy stage had caused him to be forgotten by the people; his former parliamentary supporters were principally composed of royalists, who had been willing to make an idol of him when he appeared as the heir of the Earldom of Windsor; but
Still he had many friends, admirers of his transcendent talents; his presence in the house, his eloquence, address and imposing beauty, were calculated to produce an electric effect.
Adrian also, notwithstanding his recluse habits and theories, so adverse to the spirit of party, had many friends, and they were easily induced to vote for a candidate of his selection.
The Duke of----, and Mr. Ryland, Lord Raymond's old antagonist, were the other candidates.
The Duke was supported by all the aristocrats of the republic, who considered him their proper representative.
Ryland was the popular candidate; when Lord Raymond was first added to the list, his chance of success appeared small.
We retired from the debate which had followed on his nomination: we, his nominators, mortified; he dispirited to excess.
Perdita reproached us bitterly.
Her expectations had been strongly excited; she had urged nothing against our project, on the contrary, she was evidently pleased by it; but its evident ill success changed the current of her ideas.
She felt, that, once awakened, Raymond would never return unrepining to Windsor.
His habits were unhinged; his restless mind roused from its sleep, ambition must now be his companion through life; and if he did not succeed in his present attempt, she foresaw that unhappiness and cureless discontent would follow.
Perhaps her own disappointment added a sting to her thoughts and words; she did not spare us, and our own reflections added to our disquietude.
It was necessary to follow up our nomination, and to persuade Raymond to present himself to the electors on the following evening.
For a long time he was obstinate.
He would embark in a balloon; he would sail for a distant quarter of the world, where his name and humiliation were unknown.
But this was useless; his attempt was registered; his purpose published to the world; his shame could never be erased from the memories of men.
It was as well to fail at last after a struggle, as to fly now at the beginning of his enterprise.
From the moment that he adopted this idea, he was changed.
His depression and anxiety fled; he became all life and activity.
The smile of triumph shone on his countenance; determined to pursue his object to the uttermost, his manner and expression seem ominous of the accomplishment of his wishes.
Not so Perdita.
She was frightened by his gaiety, for she dreaded a greater revulsion at the end.
If his appearance even inspired us with hope, it only rendered the state of her mind more painful.
She feared to lose sight of him; yet she dreaded to remark any change in the temper of his mind.
She listened eagerly to him, yet tantalized herself by giving to his words a meaning foreign to their true interpretation, and adverse to her hopes.
She dared not be present at the contest; yet she remained at home a prey to double solicitude.
She wept over her little girl; she looked, she spoke, as if she dreaded the occurrence of some frightful calamity.
She was half mad from the effects of uncontrollable agitation.
Lord Raymond presented himself to the house with fearless confidence and insinuating address.
After the Duke of----and Mr. Ryland had finished their speeches, he commenced.
Assuredly he had not conned his lesson; and at first he hesitated, pausing in his ideas, and in the choice of his expressions.
By degrees he warmed; his words flowed with ease, his language was full of vigour, and his voice of persuasion.
He reverted to his past life, his successes in Greece, his favour at home.
Why should he lose this, now that added years, prudence, and the pledge which his marriage gave to his country, ought to encrease, rather than diminish his claims to confidence?
He spoke of the state of England; the necessary measures to be taken to ensure its security, and confirm its prosperity.
He drew a glowing picture of its present situation.
As he spoke, every sound was hushed, every thought suspended by intense attention.
His graceful elocution enchained the senses of his hearers.
In some degree also he was fitted to reconcile all parties.
His birth pleased the aristocracy; his being the candidate recommended by Adrian, a man intimately allied to the popular party, caused a number, who had no great reliance either on the Duke or Mr. Ryland, to range on his side.
The contest was keen and doubtful.
Neither Adrian nor myself would have been so anxious, if our own success had depended on our exertions; but we had egged our friend on to the enterprise, and it became us to ensure his triumph.
Idris, who entertained the highest opinion of his abilities, was warmly interested in the event: and my poor sister, who dared not hope, and to whom fear was misery, was plunged into a fever of disquietude.
Day after day passed while we discussed our projects for the evening, and each night was occupied by debates which offered no conclusion.
At last the crisis came: the night when parliament, which had so long delayed its choice, must decide: as the hour of twelve passed, and the new day began, it was by virtue of the constitution dissolved, its power extinct.
We assembled at Raymond's house, we and our partizans.
At half past five o'clock we proceeded to the House.
Idris endeavoured to calm Perdita; but the poor girl's agitation deprived her of all power of self-command.
She walked up and down the room,--gazed wildly when any one entered, fancying that they might be the announcers of her doom.
I must do justice to my sweet sister: it was not for herself that she was thus agonized.
She alone knew the weight which Raymond attached to his success.
Even to us he assumed gaiety and hope, and assumed them so well, that we did not divine the secret workings of his mind.
Sometimes a nervous trembling, a sharp dissonance of voice, and momentary fits of absence revealed to Perdita the violence he did himself; but we, intent on our plans, observed only his ready laugh, his joke intruded on all occasions, the flow of his
Besides, Perdita was with him in his retirement; she saw the moodiness that succeeded to this forced hilarity; she marked his disturbed sleep, his painful irritability--once she had seen his tears--hers had scarce ceased to flow, since she had beheld the
What wonder then, that her feelings were wrought to this pitch!
I thus accounted to myself for her agitation; but this was not all, and the sequel revealed another excuse.
One moment we seized before our departure, to take leave of our beloved girls.
I had small hope of success, and entreated Idris to watch over my sister.
As I approached the latter, she seized my hand, and drew me into another apartment; she threw herself into my arms, and wept and sobbed bitterly and long.
I tried to soothe her; I bade her hope; I asked what tremendous consequences would ensue even on our failure.
"My brother," she cried, "protector of my childhood, dear, most dear Lionel, my fate hangs by a thread.
I have you all about me now--you, the companion of my infancy; Adrian, as dear to me as if bound by the ties of blood; Idris, the sister of my heart, and her lovely offspring.
This, O this may be the last time that you will surround me thus"!
Abruptly she stopped, and then cried: "What have I said?
--foolish false girl that I am"!
She looked wildly on me, and then suddenly calming herself, apologized for what she called her unmeaning words, saying that she must indeed be insane, for, while Raymond lived, she must be happy; and then, though she still wept, she suffered me tranquilly
Raymond only took her hand when he went, and looked on her expressively; she answered by a look of intelligence and assent.
Poor girl!
what she then suffered!
I could never entirely forgive Raymond for the trials he imposed on her, occasioned as they were by a selfish feeling on his part.
He had schemed, if he failed in his present attempt, without taking leave of any of us, to embark for Greece, and never again to revisit England.
Perdita acceded to his wishes; for his contentment was the chief object of her life, the crown of her enjoyment; but to leave us all, her companions, the beloved partners of her happiest years, and in the interim to conceal this frightful determination,
She had been employed in arranging for their departure; she had promised Raymond during this decisive evening, to take advantage of our absence, to go one stage of the journey, and he, after his defeat was ascertained, would slip away from us, and join
Although, when I was informed of this scheme, I was bitterly offended by the small attention which Raymond paid to my sister's feelings, I was led by reflection to consider, that he acted under the force of such strong excitement, as to take from him the
If he had permitted us to witness his agitation, he would have been more under the guidance of reason; but his struggles for the shew of composure, acted with such violence on his nerves, as to destroy his power of self-command.
I am convinced that, at the worst, he would have returned from the seashore to take leave of us, and to make us the partners of his council.
But the task imposed on Perdita was not the less painful.
He had extorted from her a vow of secrecy; and her part of the drama, since it was to be performed alone, was the most agonizing that could be devised.
But to return to my narrative.
The debates had hitherto been long and loud; they had often been protracted merely for the sake of delay.
But now each seemed fearful lest the fatal moment should pass, while the choice was yet undecided.
Unwonted silence reigned in the house, the members spoke in whispers, and the ordinary business was transacted with celerity and quietness.
During the first stage of the election, the Duke of----had been thrown out; the question therefore lay between Lord Raymond and Mr. Ryland.
The latter had felt secure of victory, until the appearance of Raymond; and, since his name had been inserted as a candidate, he had canvassed with eagerness.
He had appeared each evening, impatience and anger marked in his looks, scowling on us from the opposite side of St. Stephen's, as if his mere frown would cast eclipse on our hopes.
Every thing in the English constitution had been regulated for the better preservation of peace.
On the last day, two candidates only were allowed to remain; and to obviate, if possible, the last struggle between these, a bribe was offered to him who should voluntarily resign his pretensions; a place of great emolument and honour was given him, and
Strange to say however, no instance had yet occurred, where either candidate had had recourse to this expedient; in consequence the law had become obsolete, nor had been referred to by any of us in our discussions.
To our extreme surprise, when it was moved that we should resolve ourselves into a committee for the election of the Lord Protector, the member who had nominated Ryland, rose and informed us that this candidate had resigned his pretensions.
His information was at first received with silence; a confused murmur succeeded; and, when the chairman declared Lord Raymond duly chosen, it amounted to a shout of applause and victory.
It seemed as if, far from any dread of defeat even if Mr. Ryland had not resigned, every voice would have been united in favour of our candidate.
In fact, now that the idea of contest was dismissed, all hearts returned to their former respect and admiration of our accomplished friend.
Each felt, that England had never seen a Protector so capable of fulfilling the arduous duties of that high office.
One voice made of many voices, resounded through the chamber; it syllabled the name of Raymond.
He entered.
I was on one of the highest seats, and saw him walk up the passage to the table of the speaker.
The native modesty of his disposition conquered the joy of his triumph.
He looked round timidly; a mist seemed before his eyes.
Adrian, who was beside me, hastened to him, and jumping down the benches, was at his side in a moment.
His appearance re-animated our friend; and, when he came to speak and act, his hesitation vanished, and he shone out supreme in majesty and victory.
The former Protector tendered him the oaths, and presented him with the insignia of office, performing the ceremonies of installation.
The house then dissolved.
The chief members of the state crowded round the new magistrate, and conducted him to the palace of government.
Adrian suddenly vanished; and, by the time that Raymond's supporters were reduced to our intimate friends merely, returned leading Idris to congratulate her friend on his success.
But where was Perdita?
In securing solicitously an unobserved retreat in case of failure, Raymond had forgotten to arrange the mode by which she was to hear of his success; and she had been too much agitated to revert to this circumstance.
When Idris entered, so far had Raymond forgotten himself, that he asked for my sister; one word, which told of her mysterious disappearance, recalled him.
Adrian it is true had already gone to seek the fugitive, imagining that her tameless anxiety had led her to the purlieus of the House, and that some sinister event detained her.
But Raymond, without explaining himself, suddenly quitted us, and in another moment we heard him gallop down the street, in spite of the wind and rain that scattered tempest over the earth.
We did not know how far he had to go, and soon separated, supposing that in a short time he would return to the palace with Perdita, and that they would not be sorry to find themselves alone.
Perdita had arrived with her child at Dartford, weeping and inconsolable.
She directed everything to be prepared for the continuance of their journey, and placing her lovely sleeping charge on a bed, passed several hours in acute suffering.
Sometimes she observed the war of elements, thinking that they also declared against her, and listened to the pattering of the rain in gloomy despair.
Sometimes she hung over her child, tracing her resemblance to the father, and fearful lest in after life she should display the same passions and uncontrollable impulses, that rendered him unhappy.
Again, with a gush of pride and delight, she marked in the features of her little girl, the same smile of beauty that often irradiated Raymond's countenance.
The sight of it soothed her.
She thought of the treasure she possessed in the affections of her lord; of his accomplishments, surpassing those of his contemporaries, his genius, his devotion to her.
--Soon she thought, that all she possessed in the world, except him, might well be spared, nay, given with delight, a propitiatory offering, to secure the supreme good she retained in him.
Soon she imagined, that fate demanded this sacrifice from her, as a mark she was devoted to Raymond, and that it must be made with cheerfulness.
She figured to herself their life in the Greek isle he had selected for their retreat; her task of soothing him; her cares for the beauteous Clara, her rides in his company, her dedication of herself to his consolation.
The picture then presented itself to her in such glowing colours, that she feared the reverse, and a life of magnificence and power in London; where Raymond would no longer be hers only, nor she the sole source of happiness to him.
So far as she merely was concerned, she began to hope for defeat; and it was only on his account that her feelings vacillated, as she heard him gallop into the court-yard of the inn.
That he should come to her alone, wetted by the storm, careless of every thing except speed, what else could it mean, than that, vanquished and solitary, they were to take their way from native England, the scene of shame, and hide themselves in the myrtle
In a moment she was in his arms.
The knowledge of his success had become so much a part of himself, that he forgot that it was necessary to impart it to his companion.
She only felt in his embrace a dear assurance that while he possessed her, he would not despair.
"This is kind," she cried; "this is noble, my own beloved!
O fear not disgrace or lowly fortune, while you have your Perdita; fear not sorrow, while our child lives and smiles.
Let us go even where you will; the love that accompanies us will prevent our regrets".
Locked in his embrace, she spoke thus, and cast back her head, seeking an assent to her words in his eyes--they were sparkling with ineffable delight.
"Why, my little Lady Protectress," said he, playfully, "what is this you say?
And what pretty scheme have you woven of exile and obscurity, while a brighter web, a gold-enwoven tissue, is that which, in truth, you ought to contemplate"?
He kissed her brow--but the wayward girl, half sorry at his triumph, agitated by swift change of thought, hid her face in his bosom and wept.
He comforted her; he instilled into her his own hopes and desires; and soon her countenance beamed with sympathy.
How very happy were they that night!
How full even to bursting was their sense of joy!
CHAPTER VII.
HAVING seen our friend properly installed in his new office, we turned our eyes towards Windsor.
The nearness of this place to London was such, as to take away the idea of painful separation, when we quitted Raymond and Perdita.
We took leave of them in the Protectoral Palace.
It was pretty enough to see my sister enter as it were into the spirit of the drama, and endeavour to fill her station with becoming dignity.
Her internal pride and humility of manner were now more than ever at war.
Her timidity was not artificial, but arose from that fear of not being properly appreciated, that slight estimation of the neglect of the world, which also characterized Raymond.
But then Perdita thought more constantly of others than he; and part of her bashfulness arose from a wish to take from those around her a sense of inferiority; a feeling which never crossed her mind.
From the circumstances of her birth and education, Idris would have been better fitted for the formulae of ceremony; but the very ease which accompanied such actions with her, arising from habit, rendered them tedious; while, with every drawback, Perdita
She was too full of new ideas to feel much pain when we departed; she took an affectionate leave of us, and promised to visit us soon; but she did not regret the circumstances that caused our separation.
The spirits of Raymond were unbounded; he did not know what to do with his new got power; his head was full of plans; he had as yet decided on none-- but he promised himself, his friends, and the world, that the aera of his Protectorship should be
Thus, we talked of them, and moralized, as with diminished numbers we returned to Windsor Castle.
We felt extreme delight at our escape from political turmoil, and sought our solitude with redoubled zest.
We did not want for occupation; but my eager disposition was now turned to the field of intellectual exertion only; and hard study I found to be an excellent medicine to allay a fever of spirit with which in indolence, I should doubtless have been
Perdita had permitted us to take Clara back with us to Windsor; and she and my two lovely infants were perpetual sources of interest and amusement.
The only circumstance that disturbed our peace, was the health of Adrian.
It evidently declined, without any symptom which could lead us to suspect his disease, unless indeed his brightened eyes, animated look, and flustering cheeks, made us dread consumption; but he was without pain or fear.
He betook himself to books with ardour, and reposed from study in the society he best loved, that of his sister and myself.
Sometimes he went up to London to visit Raymond, and watch the progress of events.
Clara often accompanied him in these excursions; partly that she might see her parents, partly because Adrian delighted in the prattle, and intelligent looks of this lovely child.
Meanwhile all went on well in London.
The new elections were finished; parliament met, and Raymond was occupied in a thousand beneficial schemes.
Canals, aqueducts, bridges, stately buildings, and various edifices for public utility, were entered upon; he was continually surrounded by projectors and projects, which were to render England one scene of fertility and magnificence; the state of poverty
The physical state of man would soon not yield to the beatitude of angels; disease was to be banished; labour lightened of its heaviest burden.
Nor did this seem extravagant.
The arts of life, and the discoveries of science had augmented in a ratio which left all calculation behind; food sprung up, so to say, spontaneously--machines existed to supply with facility every want of the population.
An evil direction still survived; and men were not happy, not because they could not, but because they would not rouse themselves to vanquish self-raised obstacles.
Raymond was to inspire them with his beneficial will, and the mechanism of society, once systematised according to faultless rules, would never again swerve into disorder.
For these hopes he abandoned his long-cherished ambition of being enregistered in the annals of nations as a successful warrior; laying aside his sword, peace and its enduring glories became his aim--the title he coveted was that of the benefactor of his
Among other works of art in which he was engaged, he had projected the erection of a national gallery for statues and pictures.
He possessed many himself, which he designed to present to the Republic; and, as the edifice was to be the great ornament of his Protectorship, he was very fastidious in his choice of the plan on which it would be built.
Hundreds were brought to him and rejected.
He sent even to Italy and Greece for drawings; but, as the design was to be characterized by originality as well as by perfect beauty, his endeavours were for a time without avail.
At length a drawing came, with an address where communications might be sent, and no artist's name affixed.
The design was new and elegant, but faulty; so faulty, that although drawn with the hand and eye of taste, it was evidently the work of one who was not an architect.
Raymond contemplated it with delight; the more he gazed, the more pleased he was; and yet the errors multiplied under inspection.
He wrote to the address given, desiring to see the draughtsman, that such alterations might be made, as should be suggested in a consultation between him and the original conceiver.
A Greek came.
A middle-aged man, with some intelligence of manner, but with so common-place a physiognomy, that Raymond could scarcely believe that he was the designer.
He acknowledged that he was not an architect; but the idea of the building had struck him, though he had sent it without the smallest hope of its being accepted.
He was a man of few words.
Raymond questioned him; but his reserved answers soon made him turn from the man to the drawing.
He pointed out the errors, and the alterations that he wished to be made; he offered the Greek a pencil that he might correct the sketch on the spot; this was refused by his visitor, who said that he perfectly understood, and would work at it at home.
At length Raymond suffered him to depart.
The next day he returned.
The design had been re-drawn; but many defects still remained, and several of the instructions given had been misunderstood.
"Come," said Raymond, "I yielded to you yesterday, now comply with my request--take the pencil".
The Greek took it, but he handled it in no artist-like way; at length he said: "I must confess to you, my Lord, that I did not make this drawing.
It is impossible for you to see the real designer; your instructions must pass through me.
Condescend therefore to have patience with my ignorance, and to explain your wishes to me; in time I am certain that you will be satisfied".
Raymond questioned vainly; the mysterious Greek would say no more.
Would an architect be permitted to see the artist?
This also was refused.
Raymond repeated his instructions, and the visitor retired.
Our friend resolved however not to be foiled in his wish.
He suspected, that unaccustomed poverty was the cause of the mystery, and that the artist was unwilling to be seen in the garb and abode of want.
Raymond was only the more excited by this consideration to discover him; impelled by the interest he took in obscure talent, he therefore ordered a person skilled in such matters, to follow the Greek the next time he came, and observe the house in which he
His emissary obeyed, and brought the desired intelligence.
He had traced the man to one of the most penurious streets in the metropolis.
Raymond did not wonder, that, thus situated, the artist had shrunk from notice, but he did not for this alter his resolve.
On the same evening, he went alone to the house named to him.
Poverty, dirt, and squalid misery characterized its appearance.
Alas!
thought Raymond, I have much to do before England becomes a Paradise.
He knocked; the door was opened by a string from above--the broken, wretched staircase was immediately before him, but no person appeared; he knocked again, vainly--and then, impatient of further delay, he ascended the dark, creaking stairs.
His main wish, more particularly now that he witnessed the abject dwelling of the artist, was to relieve one, possessed of talent, but depressed by want.
He pictured to himself a youth, whose eyes sparkled with genius, whose person was attenuated by famine.
He half feared to displease him; but he trusted that his generous kindness would be administered so delicately, as not to excite repulse.
What human heart is shut to kindness?
and though poverty, in its excess, might render the sufferer unapt to submit to the supposed degradation of a benefit, the zeal of the benefactor must at last relax him into thankfulness.
These thoughts encouraged Raymond, as he stood at the door of the highest room of the house.
After trying vainly to enter the other apartments, he perceived just within the threshold of this one, a pair of small Turkish slippers; the door was ajar, but all was silent within.
It was probable that the inmate was absent, but secure that he had found the right person, our adventurous Protector was tempted to enter, to leave a purse on the table, and silently depart.
In pursuance of this idea, he pushed open the door gently--but the room was inhabited.
Raymond had never visited the dwellings of want, and the scene that now presented itself struck him to the heart.
The floor was sunk in many places; the walls ragged and bare--the ceiling weather-stained--a tattered bed stood in the corner; there were but two chairs in the room, and a rough broken table, on which was a light in a tin candlestick;--yet in the midst of
The thought was fleeting; for his attention was instantly drawn towards the inhabitant of this wretched abode.
It was a female.
She sat at the table; one small hand shaded her eyes from the candle; the other held a pencil; her looks were fixed on a drawing before her, which Raymond recognized as the design presented to him.
Her whole appearance awakened his deepest interest.
Her dark hair was braided and twined in thick knots like the head-dress of a Grecian statue; her garb was mean, but her attitude might have been selected as a model of grace.
Raymond had a confused remembrance that he had seen such a form before; he walked across the room; she did not raise her eyes, merely asking in Romaic, who is there?
"A friend," replied Raymond in the same dialect.
She looked up wondering, and he saw that it was Evadne Zaimi.
Evadne, once the idol of Adrian's affections; and who, for the sake of her present visitor, had disdained the noble youth, and then, neglected by him she loved, with crushed hopes and a stinging sense of misery, had returned to her native Greece.
What revolution of fortune could have brought her to England, and housed her thus?
Raymond recognized her; and his manner changed from polite beneficence to the warmest protestations of kindness and sympathy.
The sight of her, in her present situation, passed like an arrow into his soul.
He sat by her, he took her hand, and said a thousand things which breathed the deepest spirit of compassion and affection.
Evadne did not answer; her large dark eyes were cast down, at length a tear glimmered on the lashes.
"Thus," she cried, "kindness can do, what no want, no misery ever effected; I weep".
She shed indeed many tears; her head sunk unconsciously on the shoulder of Raymond; he held her hand: he kissed her sunken tear-stained cheek.
He told her, that her sufferings were now over: no one possessed the art of consoling like Raymond; he did not reason or declaim, but his look shone with sympathy; he brought pleasant images before the sufferer; his caresses excited no distrust, for they
As Evadne regained her composure, his manner became even gay; he sported with the idea of her poverty.
Something told him that it was not its real evils that lay heavily at her heart, but the debasement and disgrace attendant on it; as he talked, he divested it of these; sometimes speaking of her fortitude with energetic praise; then, alluding to her past
He made her warm offers of service; she was too much occupied by more engrossing thoughts, either to accept or reject them; at length he left her, making a promise to repeat his visit the next day.
He returned home, full of mingled feelings, of pain excited by Evadne's wretchedness, and pleasure at the prospect of relieving it.
Some motive for which he did not account, even to himself, prevented him from relating his adventure to Perdita.
The next day he threw such disguise over his person as a cloak afforded, and revisited Evadne.
As he went, he bought a basket of costly fruits, such as were natives of her own country, and throwing over these various beautiful flowers, bore it himself to the miserable garret of his friend.
"Behold," cried he, as he entered, "what bird's food I have brought for my sparrow on the house-top".
Evadne now related the tale of her misfortunes.
Her father, though of high rank, had in the end dissipated his fortune, and even destroyed his reputation and influence through a course of dissolute indulgence.
His health was impaired beyond hope of cure; and it became his earnest wish, before he died, to preserve his daughter from the poverty which would be the portion of her orphan state.
He therefore accepted for her, and persuaded her to accede to, a proposal of marriage, from a wealthy Greek merchant settled at Constantinople.
She quitted her native Greece; her father died; by degrees she was cut off from all the companions and ties of her youth.
The war, which about a year before the present time had broken out between Greece and Turkey, brought about many reverses of fortune.
Her husband became bankrupt, and then in a tumult and threatened massacre on the part of the Turks, they were obliged to fly at midnight, and reached in an open boat an English vessel under sail, which brought them immediately to this island.
The few jewels they had saved, supported them awhile.
The whole strength of Evadne's mind was exerted to support the failing spirits of her husband.
Loss of property, hopelessness as to his future prospects, the inoccupation to which poverty condemned him, combined to reduce him to a state bordering on insanity.
Five months after their arrival in England, he committed suicide.
"You will ask me," continued Evadne, "what I have done since; why I have not applied for succour to the rich Greeks resident here; why I have not returned to my native country?
My answer to these questions must needs appear to you unsatisfactory, yet they have sufficed to lead me on, day after day, enduring every wretchedness, rather than by such means to seek relief.
Shall the daughter of the noble, though prodigal Zaimi, appear a beggar before her compeers or inferiors--superiors she had none.
Shall I bow my head before them, and with servile gesture sell my nobility for life?
Had I a child, or any tie to bind me to existence, I might descend to this--but, as it is--the world has been to me a harsh step-mother; fain would I leave the abode she seems to grudge, and in the grave forget my pride, my struggles, my despair.
The time will soon come; grief and famine have already sapped the foundations of my being; a very short time, and I shall have passed away; unstained by the crime of self-destruction, unstung by the memory of degradation, my spirit will throw aside the
This may seem madness to you, yet you also have pride and resolution; do not then wonder that my pride is tameless, my resolution unalterable".
Having thus finished her tale, and given such an account as she deemed fit, of the motives of her abstaining from all endeavour to obtain aid from her countrymen, Evadne paused; yet she seemed to have more to say, to which she was unable to give words.
In the mean time Raymond was eloquent.
His desire of restoring his lovely friend to her rank in society, and to her lost prosperity, animated him, and he poured forth with energy, all his wishes and intentions on that subject.
But he was checked; Evadne exacted a promise, that he should conceal from all her friends her existence in England.
"The relatives of the Earl of Windsor," said she haughtily, "doubtless think that I injured him; perhaps the Earl himself would be the first to acquit me, but probably I do not deserve acquittal.
I acted then, as I ever must, from impulse.
This abode of penury may at least prove the disinterestedness of my conduct.
No matter: I do not wish to plead my cause before any of them, not even before your Lordship, had you not first discovered me.
The tenor of my actions will prove that I had rather die, than be a mark for scorn--behold the proud Evadne in her tatters!
look on the beggar-princess!
There is aspic venom in the thought--promise me that my secret shall not be violated by you".
Raymond promised; but then a new discussion ensued.
Evadne required another engagement on his part, that he would not without her concurrence enter into any project for her benefit, nor himself offer relief.
"Do not degrade me in my own eyes," she said; "poverty has long been my nurse; hard-visaged she is, but honest.
If dishonour, or what I conceive to be dishonour, come near me, I am lost".
Raymond adduced many arguments and fervent persuasions to overcome her feeling, but she remained unconvinced; and, agitated by the discussion, she wildly and passionately made a solemn vow, to fly and hide herself where he never could discover her, where
She could support herself, she said.
And then she shewed him how, by executing various designs and paintings, she earned a pittance for her support.
Raymond yielded for the present.
He felt assured, after he had for awhile humoured her self-will, that in the end friendship and reason would gain the day.
But the feelings that actuated Evadne were rooted in the depths of her being, and were such in their growth as he had no means of understanding.
Evadne loved Raymond.
He was the hero of her imagination, the image carved by love in the unchanged texture of her heart.
Seven years ago, in her youthful prime, she had become attached to him; he had served her country against the Turks; he had in her own land acquired that military glory peculiarly dear to the Greeks, since they were still obliged inch by inch to fight for
Yet when he returned thence, and first appeared in public life in England, her love did not purchase his, which then vacillated between Perdita and a crown.
While he was yet undecided, she had quitted England; the news of his marriage reached her, and her hopes, poorly nurtured blossoms, withered and fell.
The glory of life was gone for her; the roseate halo of love, which had imbued every object with its own colour, faded;--she was content to take life as it was, and to make the best of leaden-coloured reality.
She married; and, carrying her restless energy of character with her into new scenes, she turned her thoughts to ambition, and aimed at the title and power of Princess of Wallachia; while her patriotic feelings were soothed by the idea of the good she
She lived to find ambition, as unreal a delusion as love.
Her intrigues with Russia for the furtherance of her object, excited the jealousy of the Porte, and the animosity of the Greek government.
She was considered a traitor by both, the ruin of her husband followed; they avoided death by a timely flight, and she fell from the height of her desires to penury in England.
Much of this tale she concealed from Raymond; nor did she confess, that repulse and denial, as to a criminal convicted of the worst of crimes, that of bringing the scythe of foreign despotism to cut away the new springing liberties of her country, would
She knew that she was the cause of her husband's utter ruin; and she strung herself to bear the consequences.
The reproaches which agony extorted; or worse, cureless, uncomplaining depression, when his mind was sunk in a torpor, not the less painful because it was silent and moveless.
She reproached herself with the crime of his death; guilt and its punishments appeared to surround her; in vain she endeavoured to allay remorse by the memory of her real integrity; the rest of the world, and she among them, judged of her actions, by their
She prayed for her husband's soul; she conjured the Supreme to place on her head the crime of his self-destruction--she vowed to live to expiate his fault.
In the midst of such wretchedness as must soon have destroyed her, one thought only was matter of consolation.
She lived in the same country, breathed the same air as Raymond.
His name as Protector was the burthen of every tongue; his achievements, projects, and magnificence, the argument of every story.
Nothing is so precious to a woman's heart as the glory and excellence of him she loves; thus in every horror Evadne revelled in his fame and prosperity.
While her husband lived, this feeling was regarded by her as a crime, repressed, repented of.
When he died, the tide of love resumed its ancient flow, it deluged her soul with its tumultuous waves, and she gave herself up a prey to its uncontrollable power.
But never, O, never, should he see her in her degraded state.
Never should he behold her fallen, as she deemed, from her pride of beauty, the poverty-stricken inhabitant of a garret, with a name which had become a reproach, and a weight of guilt on her soul.
But though impenetrably veiled from him, his public office permitted her to become acquainted with all his actions, his daily course of life, even his conversation.
She allowed herself one luxury, she saw the newspapers every day, and feasted on the praise and actions of the Protector.
Not that this indulgence was devoid of accompanying grief.
Perdita's name was for ever joined with his; their conjugal felicity was celebrated even by the authentic testimony of facts.
They were continually together, nor could the unfortunate Evadne read the monosyllable that designated his name, without, at the same time, being presented with the image of her who was the faithful companion of all his labours and pleasures.
They, their Excellencies, met her eyes in each line, mingling an evil potion that poisoned her very blood.
It was in the newspaper that she saw the advertisement for the design for a national gallery.
Combining with taste her remembrance of the edifices which she had seen in the east, and by an effort of genius enduing them with unity of design, she executed the plan which had been sent to the Protector.
She triumphed in the idea of bestowing, unknown and forgotten as she was, a benefit upon him she loved; and with enthusiastic pride looked forward to the accomplishment of a work of hers, which, immortalized in stone, would go down to posterity stamped
She awaited with eagerness the return of her messenger from the palace; she listened insatiate to his account of each word, each look of the Protector; she felt bliss in this communication with her beloved, although he knew not to whom he addressed his
The drawing itself became ineffably dear to her.
He had seen it, and praised it; it was again retouched by her, each stroke of her pencil was as a chord of thrilling music, and bore to her the idea of a temple raised to celebrate the deepest and most unutterable emotions of her soul.
These contemplations engaged her, when the voice of Raymond first struck her ear, a voice, once heard, never to be forgotten; she mastered her gush of feelings, and welcomed him with quiet gentleness.
Pride and tenderness now struggled, and at length made a compromise together.
She would see Raymond, since destiny had led him to her, and her constancy and devotion must merit his friendship.
But her rights with regard to him, and her cherished independence, should not be injured by the idea of interest, or the intervention of the complicated feelings attendant on pecuniary obligation, and the relative situations of the benefactor, and
Her mind was of uncommon strength; she could subdue her sensible wants to her mental wishes, and suffer cold, hunger and misery, rather than concede to fortune a contested point.
Alas!
that in human nature such a pitch of mental discipline, and disdainful negligence of nature itself, should not have been allied to the extreme of moral excellence!
But the resolution that permitted her to resist the pains of privation, sprung from the too great energy of her passions; and the concentrated self-will of which this was a sign, was destined to destroy even the very idol, to preserve whose respect she
Their intercourse continued.
By degrees Evadne related to her friend the whole of her story, the stain her name had received in Greece, the weight of sin which had accrued to her from the death of her husband.
When Raymond offered to clear her reputation, and demonstrate to the world her real patriotism, she declared that it was only through her present sufferings that she hoped for any relief to the stings of conscience; that, in her state of mind, diseased as
She could not disguise to herself that any change would separate her from him; now she saw him each day.
His connection with Adrian and Perdita was never mentioned; he was to her a meteor, a companionless star, which at its appointed hour rose in her hemisphere, whose appearance brought felicity, and which, although it set, was never eclipsed.
He came each day to her abode of penury, and his presence transformed it to a temple redolent with sweets, radiant with heaven's own light; he partook of her delirium.
"They built a wall between them and the world"--Without, a thousand harpies raved, remorse and misery, expecting the destined moment for their invasion.
Within, was the peace as of innocence, reckless blindless, deluding joy, hope, whose still anchor rested on placid but unconstant water.
Thus, while Raymond had been wrapt in visions of power and fame, while he looked forward to entire dominion over the elements and the mind of man, the territory of his own heart escaped his notice; and from that unthought of source arose the mighty torrent
CHAPTER VIII.
IN the mean time what did Perdita?
During the first months of his Protectorate, Raymond and she had been inseparable; each project was discussed with her, each plan approved by her.
I never beheld any one so perfectly happy as my sweet sister.
Her expressive eyes were two stars whose beams were love; hope and light-heartedness sat on her cloudless brow.
She fed even to tears of joy on the praise and glory of her Lord; her whole existence was one sacrifice to him, and if in the humility of her heart she felt self-complacency, it arose from the reflection that she had won the distinguished hero of the age,
Her own feeling was as entire as at its birth.
Five years had failed to destroy the dazzling unreality of passion.
Most men ruthlessly destroy the sacred veil, with which the female heart is wont to adorn the idol of its affections.
Not so Raymond; he was an enchanter, whose reign was for ever undiminished; a king whose power never was suspended: follow him through the details of common life, still the same charm of grace and majesty adorned him; nor could he be despoiled of the
Perdita grew in beauty and excellence under his eye; I no longer recognised my reserved abstracted sister in the fascinating and open-hearted wife of Raymond.
The genius that enlightened her countenance, was now united to an expression of benevolence, which gave divine perfection to her beauty.
Happiness is in its highest degree the sister of goodness.
Suffering and amiability may exist together, and writers have loved to depict their conjunction; there is a human and touching harmony in the picture.
But perfect happiness is an attribute of angels; and those who possess it, appear angelic.
Fear has been said to be the parent of religion: even of that religion is it the generator, which leads its votaries to sacrifice human victims at its altars; but the religion which springs from happiness is a lovelier growth; the religion which makes the
Such happiness, goodness, and religion inhabited the mind of Perdita.
During the five years we had spent together, a knot of happy human beings at Windsor Castle, her blissful lot had been the frequent theme of my sister's conversation.
From early habit, and natural affection, she selected me in preference to Adrian or Idris, to be the partner in her overflowings of delight; perhaps, though apparently much unlike, some secret point of resemblance, the offspring of consanguinity, induced
Often at sunset, I have walked with her, in the sober, enshadowed forest paths, and listened with joyful sympathy.
Security gave dignity to her passion; the certainty of a full return, left her with no wish unfulfilled.
The birth of her daughter, embryo copy of her Raymond, filled up the measure of her content, and produced a sacred and indissoluble tie between them.
Sometimes she felt proud that he had preferred her to the hopes of a crown.
Sometimes she remembered that she had suffered keen anguish, when he hesitated in his choice.
But this memory of past discontent only served to enhance her present joy.
What had been hardly won, was now, entirely possessed, doubly dear.
She would look at him at a distance with the same rapture, (O, far more exuberant rapture!
) that one might feel, who after the perils of a tempest, should find himself in the desired port; she would hasten towards him, to feel more certain in his arms, the reality of her bliss.
This warmth of affection, added to the depth of her understanding, and the brilliancy of her imagination, made her beyond words dear to Raymond.
If a feeling of dissatisfaction ever crossed her, it arose from the idea that he was not perfectly happy.
Desire of renown, and presumptuous ambition, had characterized his youth.
The one he had acquired in Greece; the other he had sacrificed to love.
His intellect found sufficient field for exercise in his domestic circle, whose members, all adorned by refinement and literature, were many of them, like himself, distinguished by genius.
Yet active life was the genuine soil for his virtues; and he sometimes suffered tedium from the monotonous succession of events in our retirement.
Pride made him recoil from complaint; and gratitude and affection to Perdita, generally acted as an opiate to all desire, save that of meriting her love.
We all observed the visitation of these feelings, and none regretted them so much as Perdita.
Her life consecrated to him, was a slight sacrifice to reward his choice, but was not that sufficient--Did he need any gratification that she was unable to bestow?
This was the only cloud in the azure of her happiness.
His passage to power had been full of pain to both.
He however attained his wish; he filled the situation for which nature seemed to have moulded him.
His activity was fed in wholesome measure, without either exhaustion or satiety; his taste and genius found worthy expression in each of the modes human beings have invented to encage and manifest the spirit of beauty; the goodness of his heart made him
Habit would not dull his sense of the enjoyment of power; nor struggles, disappointment and defeat await the end of that which would expire at its maturity.
He determined to extract and condense all of glory, power, and achievement, which might have resulted from a long reign, into the three years of his Protectorate.
Raymond was eminently social.
All that he now enjoyed would have been devoid of pleasure to him, had it been unparticipated.
But in Perdita he possessed all that his heart could desire.
Her love gave birth to sympathy; her intelligence made her understand him at a word; her powers of intellect enabled her to assist and guide him.
He felt her worth.
During the early years of their union, the inequality of her temper, and yet unsubdued self-will which tarnished her character, had been a slight drawback to the fulness of his sentiment.
Now that unchanged serenity, and gentle compliance were added to her other qualifications, his respect equalled his love.
Years added to the strictness of their union.
They did not now guess at, and totter on the pathway, divining the mode to please, hoping, yet fearing the continuance of bliss.
Five years gave a sober certainty to their emotions, though it did not rob them of their etherial nature.
It had given them a child; but it had not detracted from the personal attractions of my sister.
Timidity, which in her had almost amounted to awkwardness, was exchanged for a graceful decision of manner; frankness, instead of reserve, characterized her physiognomy; and her voice was attuned to thrilling softness.
She was now three and twenty, in the pride of womanhood, fulfilling the precious duties of wife and mother, possessed of all her heart had ever coveted.
Raymond was ten years older; to his previous beauty, noble mien, and commanding aspect, he now added gentlest benevolence, winning tenderness, graceful and unwearied attention to the wishes of another.
The first secret that had existed between them was the visits of Raymond to Evadne.
He had been struck by the fortitude and beauty of the ill-fated Greek; and, when her constant tenderness towards him unfolded itself, he asked with astonishment, by what act of his he had merited this passionate and unrequited love.
She was for a while the sole object of his reveries; and Perdita became aware that his thoughts and time were bestowed on a subject unparticipated by her.
My sister was by nature destitute of the common feelings of anxious, petulant jealousy.
The treasure which she possessed in the affections of Raymond, was more necessary to her being, than the life-blood that animated her veins--more truly than Othello she might say, To be once in doubt, Is--once to be resolved.
On the present occasion she did not suspect any alienation of affection; but she conjectured that some circumstance connected with his high place, had occasioned this mystery.
She was startled and pained.
She began to count the long days, and months, and years which must elapse, before he would be restored to a private station, and unreservedly to her.
She was not content that, even for a time, he should practice concealment with her.
She often repined; but her trust in the singleness of his affection was undisturbed; and, when they were together, unchecked by fear, she opened her heart to the fullest delight.
Time went on.
Raymond, stopping mid-way in his wild career, paused suddenly to think of consequences.
Two results presented themselves in the view he took of the future.
That his intercourse with Evadne should continue a secret to, or that finally it should be discovered by Perdita.
The destitute condition, and highly wrought feelings of his friend prevented him from adverting to the possibility of exiling himself from her.
In the first event he had bidden an eternal farewell to open-hearted converse, and entire sympathy with the companion of his life.
The veil must be thicker than that invented by Turkish jealousy; the wall higher than the unscaleable tower of Vathek, which should conceal from her the workings of his heart, and hide from her view the secret of his actions.
This idea was intolerably painful to him.
Frankness and social feelings were the essence of Raymond's nature; without them his qualities became common-place; without these to spread glory over his intercourse with Perdita, his vaunted exchange of a throne for her love, was as weak and empty as the
But there was no remedy.
Genius, devotion, and courage; the adornments of his mind, and the energies of his soul, all exerted to their uttermost stretch, could not roll back one hair's breadth the wheel of time's chariot; that which had been was written with the adamantine pen of
But this was the best side of the question.
What, if circumstance should lead Perdita to suspect, and suspecting to be resolved?
The fibres of his frame became relaxed, and cold dew stood on his forehead, at this idea.
Many men may scoff at his dread; but he read the future; and the peace of Perdita was too dear to him, her speechless agony too certain, and too fearful, not to unman him.
His course was speedily decided upon.
If the worst befell; if she learnt the truth, he would neither stand her reproaches, or the anguish of her altered looks.
He would forsake her, England, his friends, the scenes of his youth, the hopes of coming time, he would seek another country, and in other scenes begin life again.
Having resolved on this, he became calmer.
He endeavoured to guide with prudence the steeds of destiny through the devious road which he had chosen, and bent all his efforts the better to conceal what he could not alter.
The perfect confidence that subsisted between Perdita and him, rendered every communication common between them.
They opened each other's letters, even as, until now, the inmost fold of the heart of each was disclosed to the other.
A letter came unawares, Perdita read it.
Had it contained confirmation, she must have been annihilated.
As it was, trembling, cold, and pale, she sought Raymond.
He was alone, examining some petitions lately presented.
She entered silently, sat on a sofa opposite to him, and gazed on him with a look of such despair, that wildest shrieks and dire moans would have been tame exhibitions of misery, compared to the living incarnation of the thing itself exhibited by her.
At first he did not take his eyes from the papers; when he raised them, he was struck by the wretchedness manifest on her altered cheek; for a moment he forgot his own acts and fears, and asked with consternation--"Dearest girl, what is the matter; what
"Nothing," she replied at first; "and yet not so," she continued, hurrying on in her speech; "you have secrets, Raymond; where have you been lately, whom have you seen, what do you conceal from me?
--why am I banished from your confidence?
Yet this is not it--I do not intend to entrap you with questions--one will suffice--am I completely a wretch"?
With trembling hand she gave him the paper, and sat white and motionless looking at him while he read it.
He recognised the hand-writing of Evadne, and the colour mounted in his cheeks.
With lightning-speed he conceived the contents of the letter; all was now cast on one die; falsehood and artifice were trifles in comparison with the impending ruin.
He would either entirely dispel Perdita's suspicions, or quit her for ever.
"My dear girl," he said, "I have been to blame; but you must pardon me.
I was in the wrong to commence a system of concealment; but I did it for the sake of sparing you pain; and each day has rendered it more difficult for me to alter my plan.
Besides, I was instigated by delicacy towards the unhappy writer of these few lines".
Perdita gasped: "Well," she cried, "well, go on"!
"That is all--this paper tells all.
I am placed in the most difficult circumstances.
I have done my best, though perhaps I have done wrong.
My love for you is inviolate".
Perdita shook her head doubtingly: "It cannot be," she cried, "I know that it is not.
You would deceive me, but I will not be deceived.
I have lost you, myself, my life"!
"Do you not believe me"?
said Raymond haughtily.
"To believe you," she exclaimed, "I would give up all, and expire with joy, so that in death I could feel that you were true--but that cannot be"!
"Perdita," continued Raymond, "you do not see the precipice on which you stand.
You may believe that I did not enter on my present line of conduct without reluctance and pain.
I knew that it was possible that your suspicions might be excited; but I trusted that my simple word would cause them to disappear.
I built my hope on your confidence.
Do you think that I will be questioned, and my replies disdainfully set aside?
Do you think that I will be suspected, perhaps watched, cross-questioned, and disbelieved?
I am not yet fallen so low; my honour is not yet so tarnished.
You have loved me; I adored you.
But all human sentiments come to an end.
Let our affection expire--but let it not be exchanged for distrust and recrimination.
Heretofore we have been friends--lovers--let us not become enemies, mutual spies.
I cannot live the object of suspicion--you cannot believe me--let us part"!
"Exactly so," cried Perdita, "I knew that it would come to this!
Are we not already parted?
Does not a stream, boundless as ocean, deep as vacuum, yawn between us"?
Raymond rose, his voice was broken, his features convulsed, his manner calm as the earthquake-cradling atmosphere, he replied: "I am rejoiced that you take my decision so philosophically.
Doubtless you will play the part of the injured wife to admiration.
Sometimes you may be stung with the feeling that you have wronged me, but the condolence of your relatives, the pity of the world, the complacency which the consciousness of your own immaculate innocence will bestow, will be excellent balm;--me you will
Raymond moved towards the door.
He forgot that each word he spoke was false.
He personated his assumption of innocence even to self-deception.
Have not actors wept, as they pourtrayed imagined passion?
A more intense feeling of the reality of fiction possessed Raymond.
He spoke with pride; he felt injured.
Perdita looked up; she saw his angry glance; his hand was on the lock of the door.
She started up, she threw herself on his neck, she gasped and sobbed; he took her hand, and leading her to the sofa, sat down near her.
Her head fell on his shoulder, she trembled, alternate changes of fire and ice ran through her limbs: observing her emotion he spoke with softened accents: "The blow is given.
I will not part from you in anger;--I owe you too much.
I owe you six years of unalloyed happiness.
But they are passed.
I will not live the mark of suspicion, the object of jealousy.
I love you too well.
In an eternal separation only can either of us hope for dignity and propriety of action.
We shall not then be degraded from our true characters.
Faith and devotion have hitherto been the essence of our intercourse;--these lost, let us not cling to the seedless husk of life, the unkernelled shell.
You have your child, your brother, Idris, Adrian"-- "And you," cried Perdita, "the writer of that letter".
Uncontrollable indignation flashed from the eyes of Raymond.
He knew that this accusation at least was false.
"Entertain this belief," he cried, "hug it to your heart--make it a pillow to your head, an opiate for your eyes --I am content.
But, by the God that made me, hell is not more false than the word you have spoken"!
Perdita was struck by the impassioned seriousness of his asseverations.
She replied with earnestness, "I do not refuse to believe you, Raymond; on the contrary I promise to put implicit faith in your simple word.
Only assure me that your love and faith towards me have never been violated; and suspicion, and doubt, and jealousy will at once be dispersed.
We shall continue as we have ever done, one heart, one hope, one life".
"I have already assured you of my fidelity," said Raymond with disdainful coldness, "triple assertions will avail nothing where one is despised.
I will say no more; for I can add nothing to what I have already said, to what you before contemptuously set aside.
This contention is unworthy of both of us; and I confess that I am weary of replying to charges at once unfounded and unkind".
Perdita tried to read his countenance, which he angrily averted.
There was so much of truth and nature in his resentment, that her doubts were dispelled.
Her countenance, which for years had not expressed a feeling unallied to affection, became again radiant and satisfied.
She found it however no easy task to soften and reconcile Raymond.
At first he refused to stay to hear her.
But she would not be put off; secure of his unaltered love, she was willing to undertake any labour, use any entreaty, to dispel his anger.
She obtained an hearing, he sat in haughty silence, but he listened.
She first assured him of her boundless confidence; of this he must be conscious, since but for that she would not seek to detain him.
She enumerated their years of happiness; she brought before him past scenes of intimacy and happiness; she pictured their future life, she mentioned their child--tears unbidden now filled her eyes.
She tried to disperse them, but they refused to be checked--her utterance was choaked.
She had not wept before.
Raymond could not resist these signs of distress: he felt perhaps somewhat ashamed of the part he acted of the injured man, he who was in truth the injurer.
And then he devoutly loved Perdita; the bend of her head, her glossy ringlets, the turn of her form were to him subjects of deep tenderness and admiration; as she spoke, her melodious tones entered his soul; he soon softened towards her, comforting and
Raymond staggered forth from this scene, as a man might do, who had been just put to the torture, and looked forward to when it would be again inflicted.
He had sinned against his own honour, by affirming, swearing to, a direct falsehood; true this he had palmed on a woman, and it might therefore be deemed less base--by others--not by him;--for whom had he deceived?
--his own trusting, devoted, affectionate Perdita, whose generous belief galled him doubly, when he remembered the parade of innocence with which it had been exacted.
The mind of Raymond was not so rough cast, nor had been so rudely handled, in the circumstance of life, as to make him proof to these considerations--on the contrary, he was all nerve; his spirit was as a pure fire, which fades and shrinks from every
Truth and falsehood, love and hate lost their eternal boundaries, heaven rushed in to mingle with hell; while his sensitive mind, turned to a field for such battle, was stung to madness.
He heartily despised himself, he was angry with Perdita, and the idea of Evadne was attended by all that was hideous and cruel.
His passions, always his masters, acquired fresh strength, from the long sleep in which love had cradled them, the clinging weight of destiny bent him down; he was goaded, tortured, fiercely impatient of that worst of miseries, the sense of remorse.
This troubled state yielded by degrees, to sullen animosity, and depression of spirits.
His dependants, even his equals, if in his present post he had any, were startled to find anger, derision, and bitterness in one, before distinguished for suavity and benevolence of manner.
He transacted public business with distaste, and hastened from it to the solitude which was at once his bane and relief.
He mounted a fiery horse, that which had borne him forward to victory in Greece; he fatigued himself with deadening exercise, losing the pangs of a troubled mind in animal sensation.
He slowly recovered himself; yet, at last, as one might from the effects of poison, he lifted his head from above the vapours of fever and passion into the still atmosphere of calm reflection.
He meditated on what was best to be done.
He was first struck by the space of time that had elapsed, since madness, rather than any reasonable impulse, had regulated his actions.
A month had gone by, and during that time he had not seen Evadne.
Her power, which was linked to few of the enduring emotions of his heart, had greatly decayed.
He was no longer her slave--no longer her lover: he would never see her more, and by the completeness of his return, deserve the confidence of Perdita.
Yet, as he thus determined, fancy conjured up the miserable abode of the Greek girl.
An abode, which from noble and lofty principle, she had refused to exchange for one of greater luxury.
He thought of the splendour of her situation and appearance when he first knew her; he thought of her life at Constantinople, attended by every circumstance of oriental magnificence; of her present penury, her daily task of industry, her lorn state, her
Compassion swelled his breast; he would see her once again; he would devise some plan for restoring her to society, and the enjoyment of her rank; their separation would then follow, as a matter of course.
Again he thought, how during this long month, he had avoided Perdita, flying from her as from the stings of his own conscience.
But he was awake now; all this should be remedied; and future devotion erase the memory of this only blot on the serenity of their life.
He became cheerful, as he thought of this, and soberly and resolutely marked out the line of conduct he would adopt.
He remembered that he had promised Perdita to be present this very evening (the 19th of October, anniversary of his election as Protector) at a festival given in his honour.
Good augury should this festival be of the happiness of future years.
First, he would look in on Evadne; he would not stay; but he owed her some account, some compensation for his long and unannounced absence; and then to Perdita, to the forgotten world, to the duties of society, the splendour of rank, the enjoyment of
After the scene sketched in the preceding pages, Perdita had contemplated an entire change in the manners and conduct of Raymond.
She expected freedom of communication, and a return to those habits of affectionate intercourse which had formed the delight of her life.
But Raymond did not join her in any of her avocations.
He transacted the business of the day apart from her; he went out, she knew not whither.
The pain inflicted by this disappointment was tormenting and keen.
She looked on it as a deceitful dream, and tried to throw off the consciousness of it; but like the shirt of Nessus, it clung to her very flesh, and ate with sharp agony into her vital principle.
She possessed that (though such an assertion may appear a paradox) which belongs to few, a capacity of happiness.
Her delicate organization and creative imagination rendered her peculiarly susceptible of pleasurable emotion.
The overflowing warmth of her heart, by making love a plant of deep root and stately growth, had attuned her whole soul to the reception of happiness, when she found in Raymond all that could adorn love and satisfy her imagination.
But if the sentiment on which the fabric of her existence was founded, became common place through participation, the endless succession of attentions and graceful action snapt by transfer, his universe of love wrested from her, happiness must depart, and
The same peculiarities of character rendered her sorrows agonies; her fancy magnified them, her sensibility made her for ever open to their renewed impression; love envenomed the heart-piercing sting.
There was neither submission, patience, nor self-abandonment in her grief; she fought with it, struggled beneath it, and rendered every pang more sharp by resistance.
Again and again the idea recurred, that he loved another.
She did him justice; she believed that he felt a tender affection for her; but give a paltry prize to him who in some life-pending lottery has calculated on the possession of tens of thousands, and it will disappoint him more than a blank.
The affection and amity of a Raymond might be inestimable; but, beyond that affection, embosomed deeper than friendship, was the indivisible treasure of love.
Take the sum in its completeness, and no arithmetic can calculate its price; take from it the smallest portion, give it but the name of parts, separate it into degrees and sections, and like the magician's coin, the valueless gold of the mine, is turned to
There is a meaning in the eye of love; a cadence in its voice, an irradiation in its smile, the talisman of whose enchantments one only can possess; its spirit is elemental, its essence single, its divinity an unit.
The very heart and soul of Raymond and Perdita had mingled, even as two mountain brooks that join in their descent, and murmuring and sparkling flow over shining pebbles, beside starry flowers; but let one desert its primal course, or be dammed up by
Perdita was sensible of the failing of the tide that fed her life.
Unable to support the slow withering of her hopes, she suddenly formed a plan, resolving to terminate at once the period of misery, and to bring to an happy conclusion the late disastrous events.
The anniversary was at hand of the exaltation of Raymond to the office of Protector; and it was customary to celebrate this day by a splendid festival.
A variety of feelings urged Perdita to shed double magnificence over the scene; yet, as she arrayed herself for the evening gala, she wondered herself at the pains she took, to render sumptuous the celebration of an event which appeared to her the
Woe befall the day, she thought, woe, tears, and mourning betide the hour, that gave Raymond another hope than love, another wish than my devotion; and thrice joyful the moment when he shall be restored to me!
God knows, I put my trust in his vows, and believe his asserted faith--but for that, I would not seek what I am now resolved to attain.
Shall two years more be thus passed, each day adding to our alienation, each act being another stone piled on the barrier which separates us?
No, my Raymond, my only beloved, sole possession of Perdita!
This night, this splendid assembly, these sumptuous apartments, and this adornment of your tearful girl, are all united to celebrate your abdication.
Once for me, you relinquished the prospect of a crown.
That was in days of early love, when I could only hold out the hope, not the assurance of happiness.
Now you have the experience of all that I can give, the heart's devotion, taintless love, and unhesitating subjection to you.
You must choose between these and your protectorate.
This, proud noble, is your last night!
Perdita has bestowed on it all of magnificent and dazzling that your heart best loves--but, from these gorgeous rooms, from this princely attendance, from power and elevation, you must return with to-morrow's sun to our rural abode; for I would not buy an
Brooding over this plan, resolved when the hour should come, to propose, and insist upon its accomplishment, secure of his consent, the heart of Perdita was lightened, or rather exalted.
Her cheek was flushed by the expectation of struggle; her eyes sparkled with the hope of triumph.
Having cast her fate upon a die, and feeling secure of winning, she, whom I have named as bearing the stamp of queen of nations on her noble brow, now rose superior to humanity, and seemed in calm power, to arrest with her finger, the wheel of destiny.
She had never before looked so supremely lovely.
We, the Arcadian shepherds of the tale, had intended to be present at this festivity, but Perdita wrote to entreat us not to come, or to absent ourselves from Windsor; for she (though she did not reveal her scheme to us) resolved the next morning to return
Late in the evening she entered the apartments appropriated to the festival.
Raymond had quitted the palace the night before; he had promised to grace the assembly, but he had not yet returned.
Still she felt sure that he would come at last; and the wider the breach might appear at this crisis, the more secure she was of closing it for ever.
It was as I said, the nineteenth of October; the autumn was far advanced and dreary.
The wind howled; the half bare trees were despoiled of the remainder of their summer ornament; the state of the air which induced the decay of vegetation, was hostile to cheerfulness or hope.
Raymond had been exalted by the determination he had made; but with the declining day his spirits declined.
First he was to visit Evadne, and then to hasten to the palace of the Protectorate.
As he walked through the wretched streets in the neighbourhood of the luckless Greek's abode, his heart smote him for the whole course of his conduct towards her.
First, his having entered into any engagement that should permit her to remain in such a state of degradation; and then, after a short wild dream, having left her to drear solitude, anxious conjecture, and bitter, still--disappointed expectation.
What had she done the while, how supported his absence and neglect?
Light grew dim in these close streets, and when the well known door was opened, the staircase was shrouded in perfect night.
He groped his way up, he entered the garret, he found Evadne stretched speechless, almost lifeless on her wretched bed.
He called for the people of the house, but could learn nothing from them, except that they knew nothing.
Her story was plain to him, plain and distinct as the remorse and horror that darted their fangs into him.
When she found herself forsaken by him, she lost the heart to pursue her usual avocations; pride forbade every application to him; famine was welcomed as the kind porter to the gates of death, within whose opening folds she should now, without sin, quickly
No creature came near her, as her strength failed.
If she died, where could there be found on record a murderer, whose cruel act might compare with his?
What fiend more wanton in his mischief, what damned soul more worthy of perdition!
But he was not reserved for this agony of self-reproach.
He sent for medical assistance; the hours passed, spun by suspense into ages; the darkness of the long autumnal night yielded to day, before her life was secure.
He had her then removed to a more commodious dwelling, and hovered about her, again and again to assure himself that she was safe.
In the midst of his greatest suspense and fear as to the event, he remembered the festival given in his honour, by Perdita; in his honour then, when misery and death were affixing indelible disgrace to his name, honour to him whose crimes deserved a
Still Perdita would expect him; he wrote a few incoherent words on a scrap of paper, testifying that he was well, and bade the woman of the house take it to the palace, and deliver it into the hands of the wife of the Lord Protector.
The woman, who did not know him, contemptuously asked, how he thought she should gain admittance, particularly on a festal night, to that lady's presence?
Raymond gave her his ring to ensure the respect of the menials.
Thus, while Perdita was entertaining her guests, and anxiously awaiting the arrival of her lord, his ring was brought her; and she was told that a poor woman had a note to deliver to her from its wearer.
The vanity of the old gossip was raised by her commission, which, after all, she did not understand, since she had no suspicion, even now that Evadne's visitor was Lord Raymond.
Perdita dreaded a fall from his horse, or some similar accident--till the woman's answers woke other fears.
From a feeling of cunning blindly exercised, the officious, if not malignant messenger, did not speak of Evadne's illness; but she garrulously gave an account of Raymond's frequent visits, adding to her narration such circumstances, as, while they
Worst of all, his absence now from the festival, his message wholly unaccounted for, except by the disgraceful hints of the woman, appeared the deadliest insult.
Again she looked at the ring, it was a small ruby, almost heart-shaped, which she had herself given him.
She looked at the hand-writing, which she could not mistake, and repeated to herself the words--"Do not, I charge you, I entreat you, permit your guests to wonder at my absence:" the while the old crone going on with her talk, filled her ear with a strange
At length Perdita dismissed her.
The poor girl returned to the assembly, where her presence had not been missed.
She glided into a recess somewhat obscured, and leaning against an ornamental column there placed, tried to recover herself.
Her faculties were palsied.
She gazed on some flowers that stood near in a carved vase: that morning she had arranged them, they were rare and lovely plants; even now all aghast as she was, she observed their brilliant colours and starry shapes.
--"Divine infoliations of the spirit of beauty," she exclaimed, "Ye droop not, neither do ye mourn; the despair that clasps my heart, has not spread contagion over you!
--Why am I not a partner of your insensibility, a sharer in your calm"!
She paused.
"To my task," she continued mentally, "my guests must not perceive the reality, either as it regards him or me.
I obey; they shall not, though I die the moment they are gone.
They shall behold the antipodes of what is real--for I will appear to live--while I am--dead".
It required all her self-command, to suppress the gush of tears self-pity caused at this idea.
After many struggles, she succeeded, and turned to join the company.
All her efforts were now directed to the dissembling her internal conflict.
She had to play the part of a courteous hostess; to attend to all; to shine the focus of enjoyment and grace.
She had to do this, while in deep woe she sighed for loneliness, and would gladly have exchanged her crowded rooms for dark forest depths, or a drear, night-enshadowed heath.
But she became gay.
She could not keep in the medium, nor be, as was usual with her, placidly content.
Every one remarked her exhilaration of spirits; as all actions appear graceful in the eye of rank, her guests surrounded her applaudingly, although there was a sharpness in her laugh, and an abruptness in her sallies, which might have betrayed her secret
She went on, feeling that, if she had paused for a moment, the checked waters of misery would have deluged her soul, that her wrecked hopes would raise their wailing voices, and that those who now echoed her mirth, and provoked her repartees, would have
Her only consolation during the violence which she did herself, was to watch the motions of an illuminated clock, and internally count the moments which must elapse before she could be alone.
At length the rooms began to thin.
Mocking her own desires, she rallied her guests on their early departure.
One by one they left her--at length she pressed the hand of her last visitor.
"How cold and damp your hand is," said her friend; "you are over fatigued, pray hasten to rest".
Perdita smiled faintly--her guest left her; the carriage rolling down the street assured the final departure.
Then, as if pursued by an enemy, as if wings had been at her feet, she flew to her own apartment, she dismissed her attendants, she locked the doors, she threw herself wildly on the floor, she bit her lips even to blood to suppress her shrieks, and lay
At length she rose, more composed, not less miserable.
She stood before a large mirror--she gazed on her reflected image; her light and graceful dress, the jewels that studded her hair, and encircled her beauteous arms and neck, her small feet shod in satin, her profuse and glossy tresses, all were to her
"Vase am I," she thought, "vase brimful of despair's direst essence.
Farewell, Perdita!
farewell, poor girl!
never again will you see yourself thus; luxury and wealth are no longer yours; in the excess of your poverty you may envy the homeless beggar; most truly am I without a home!
I live on a barren desart, which, wide and interminable, brings forth neither fruit or flower; in the midst is a solitary rock, to which thou, Perdita, art chained, and thou seest the dreary level stretch far away".
She threw open her window, which looked on the palace-garden.
Light and darkness were struggling together, and the orient was streaked by roseate and golden rays.
One star only trembled in the depth of the kindling atmosphere.
The morning air blowing freshly over the dewy plants, rushed into the heated room.
"All things go on," thought Perdita, "all things proceed, decay, and perish!
When noontide has passed, and the weary day has driven her team to their western stalls, the fires of heaven rise from the East, moving in their accustomed path, they ascend and descend the skiey hill.
When their course is fulfilled, the dial begins to cast westward an uncertain shadow; the eye-lids of day are opened, and birds and flowers, the startled vegetation, and fresh breeze awaken; the sun at length appears, and in majestic procession climbs the
All proceeds, changes and dies, except the sense of misery in my bursting heart.
"Ay, all proceeds and changes: what wonder then, that love has journied on to its setting, and that the lord of my life has changed?
We call the supernal lights fixed, yet they wander about yonder plain, and if I look again where I looked an hour ago, the face of the eternal heavens is altered.
The silly moon and inconstant planets vary nightly their erratic dance; the sun itself, sovereign of the sky, ever and anon deserts his throne, and leaves his dominion to night and winter.
Nature grows old, and shakes in her decaying limbs,--creation has become bankrupt!
What wonder then, that eclipse and death have led to destruction the light of thy life, O Perdita"!
CHAPTER IX.
THUS sad and disarranged were the thoughts of my poor sister, when she became assured of the infidelity of Raymond.
All her virtues and all her defects tended to make the blow incurable.
Her affection for me, her brother, for Adrian and Idris, was subject as it were to the reigning passion of her heart; even her maternal tenderness borrowed half its force from the delight she had in tracing Raymond's features and expression in the infant's
She had been reserved and even stern in childhood; but love had softened the asperities of her character, and her union with Raymond had caused her talents and affections to unfold themselves; the one betrayed, and the other lost, she in some degree
The concentrated pride of her nature, forgotten during her blissful dream, awoke, and with its adder's sting pierced her heart; her humility of spirit augmented the power of the venom; she had been exalted in her own estimation, while distinguished by his
She had been proud of having won and preserved him--but another had won him from her, and her exultation was as cold as a water quenched ember.
We, in our retirement, remained long in ignorance of her misfortune.
Soon after the festival she had sent for her child, and then she seemed to have forgotten us.
Adrian observed a change during a visit that he afterward paid them; but he could not tell its extent, or divine the cause.
They still appeared in public together, and lived under the same roof.
Raymond was as usual courteous, though there was, on occasions, an unbidden haughtiness, or painful abruptness in his manners, which startled his gentle friend; his brow was not clouded but disdain sat on his lips, and his voice was harsh.
Perdita was all kindness and attention to her lord; but she was silent, and beyond words sad.
She had grown thin and pale; and her eyes often filled with tears.
Sometimes she looked at Raymond, as if to say--That it should be so!
At others her countenance expressed--I will still do all I can to make you happy.
But Adrian read with uncertain aim the charactery of her face, and might mistake.
--Clara was always with her, and she seemed most at ease, when, in an obscure corner, she could sit holding her child's hand, silent and lonely.
Still Adrian was unable to guess the truth; he entreated them to visit us at Windsor, and they promised to come during the following month.
It was May before they arrived: the season had decked the forest trees with leaves, and its paths with a thousand flowers.
We had notice of their intention the day before; and, early in the morning, Perdita arrived with her daughter.
Raymond would follow soon, she said; he had been detained by business.
According to Adrian's account, I had expected to find her sad; but, on the contrary, she appeared in the highest spirits: true, she had grown thin, her eyes were somewhat hollow, and her cheeks sunk, though tinged by a bright glow.
She was delighted to see us; caressed our children, praised their growth and improvement; Clara also was pleased to meet again her young friend Alfred; all kinds of childish games were entered into, in which Perdita joined.
She communicated her gaiety to us, and as we amused ourselves on the Castle Terrace, it appeared that a happier, less care-worn party could not have been assembled.
"This is better, Mamma," said Clara, "than being in that dismal London, where you often cry, and never laugh as you do now".
--"Silence, little foolish thing," replied her mother, "and remember any one that mentions London is sent to Coventry for an hour".
Soon after, Raymond arrived.
He did not join as usual in the playful spirit of the rest; but, entering into conversation with Adrian and myself, by degrees we seceded from our companions, and Idris and Perdita only remained with the children.
Raymond talked of his new buildings; of his plan for an establishment for the better education of the poor; as usual Adrian and he entered into argument, and the time slipped away unperceived.
We assembled again towards evening, and Perdita insisted on our having recourse to music.
She wanted, she said, to give us a specimen of her new accomplishment; for since she had been in London, she had applied herself to music, and sang, without much power, but with a great deal of sweetness.
We were not permitted by her to select any but light-hearted melodies; and all the Operas of Mozart were called into service, that we might choose the most exhilarating of his airs.
Among the other transcendant attributes of Mozart's music, it possesses more than any other that of appearing to come from the heart; you enter into the passions expressed by him, and are transported with grief, joy, anger, or confusion, as he, our soul's
For some time, the spirit of hilarity was kept up; but, at length, Perdita receded from the piano, for Raymond had joined in the trio of "Taci ingiusto core," in Don Giovanni, whose arch entreaty was softened by him into tenderness, and thrilled her heart
Soon after Idris, who was at the harp, turned to that passionate and sorrowful air in Figaro, "Porgi, amor, qualche risforo," in which the deserted Countess laments the change of the faithless Almaviva.
The soul of tender sorrow is breathed forth in this strain; and the sweet voice of Idris, sustained by the mournful chords of her instrument, added to the expression of the words.
During the pathetic appeal with which it concludes, a stifled sob attracted our attention to Perdita, the cessation of the music recalled her to herself, she hastened out of the hall--I followed her.
At first, she seemed to wish to shun me; and then, yielding to my earnest questioning, she threw herself on my neck, and wept aloud:--"Once more," she cried, "once more on your friendly breast, my beloved brother, can the lost Perdita pour forth her
I had imposed a law of silence on myself; and for months I have kept it.
I do wrong in weeping now, and greater wrong in giving words to my grief.
I will not speak!
Be it enough for you to know that I am miserable--be it enough for you to know, that the painted veil of life is rent, that I sit for ever shrouded in darkness and gloom, that grief is my sister, everlasting lamentation my mate"!
I endeavoured to console her; I did not question her!
but I caressed her, assured her of my deepest affection and my intense interest in the changes of her fortune:--"Dear words," she cried, "expressions of love come upon my ear, like the remembered sounds of forgotten music, that had been dear to me.
They are vain, I know; how very vain in their attempt to soothe or comfort me.
Dearest Lionel, you cannot guess what I have suffered during these long months.
I have read of mourners in ancient days, who clothed themselves in sackcloth, scattered dust upon their heads, ate their bread mingled with ashes, and took up their abode on the bleak mountain tops, reproaching heaven and earth aloud with their
Why this is the very luxury of sorrow!
thus one might go on from day to day contriving new extravagances, revelling in the paraphernalia of woe, wedded to all the appurtenances of despair.
Alas!
I must for ever conceal the wretchedness that consumes me.
I must weave a veil of dazzling falsehood to hide my grief from vulgar eyes, smoothe my brow, and paint my lips in deceitful smiles--even in solitude I dare not think how lost I am, lest I become insane and rave".
The tears and agitation of my poor sister had rendered her unfit to return to the circle we had left--so I persuaded her to let me drive her through the park; and, during the ride, I induced her to confide the tale of her unhappiness to me, fancying that
Several weeks had elapsed since the festival of the anniversary, and she had been unable to calm her mind, or to subdue her thoughts to any regular train.
Sometimes she reproached herself for taking too bitterly to heart, that which many would esteem an imaginary evil; but this was no subject for reason; and, ignorant as she was of the motives and true conduct of Raymond, things assumed for her even a worse
He was seldom at the palace; never, but when he was assured that his public duties would prevent his remaining alone with Perdita.
They seldom addressed each other, shunning explanation, each fearing any communication the other might make.
Suddenly, however, the manners of Raymond changed; he appeared to desire to find opportunities of bringing about a return to kindness and intimacy with my sister.
The tide of love towards her appeared to flow again; he could never forget, how once he had been devoted to her, making her the shrine and storehouse wherein to place every thought and every sentiment.
Shame seemed to hold him back; yet he evidently wished to establish a renewal of confidence and affection.
From the moment Perdita had sufficiently recovered herself to form any plan of action, she had laid one down, which now she prepared to follow.
She received these tokens of returning love with gentleness; she did not shun his company; but she endeavoured to place a barrier in the way of familiar intercourse or painful discussion, which mingled pride and shame prevented Raymond from surmounting.
He began at last to shew signs of angry impatience, and Perdita became aware that the system she had adopted could not continue; she must explain herself to him; she could not summon courage to speak--she wrote thus:-- "Read this letter with patience, I
It will contain no reproaches.
Reproach is indeed an idle word: for what should I reproach you?
"Allow me in some degree to explain my feeling; without that, we shall both grope in the dark, mistaking one another; erring from the path which may conduct, one of us at least, to a more eligible mode of life than that led by either during the last few
"I loved you--I love you--neither anger nor pride dictates these lines; but a feeling beyond, deeper, and more unalterable than either.
My affections are wounded; it is impossible to heal them:--cease then the vain endeavour, if indeed that way your endeavours tend.
Forgiveness!
Return!
Idle words are these!
I forgive the pain I endure; but the trodden path cannot be retraced.
"Common affection might have been satisfied with common usages.
I believed that you read my heart, and knew its devotion, its unalienable fidelity towards you.
I never loved any but you.
You came the embodied image of my fondest dreams.
The praise of men, power and high aspirations attended your career.
Love for you invested the world for me in enchanted light; it was no longer the earth I trod--the earth, common mother, yielding only trite and stale repetition of objects and circumstances old and worn out.
I lived in a temple glorified by intensest sense of devotion and rapture; I walked, a consecrated being, contemplating only your power, your excellence; For O, you stood beside me, like my youth, Transformed for me the real to a dream, Cloathing the
'The bloom has vanished from my life'--there is no morning to this all investing night; no rising to the set-sun of love.
In those days the rest of the world was nothing to me: all other men--I never considered nor felt what they were; nor did I look on you as one of them.
Separated from them; exalted in my heart; sole possessor of my affections; single object of my hopes, the best half of myself.
"Ah, Raymond, were we not happy?
Did the sun shine on any, who could enjoy its light with purer and more intense bliss?
It was not--it is not a common infidelity at which I repine.
It is the disunion of an whole which may not have parts; it is the carelessness with which you have shaken off the mantle of election with which to me you were invested, and have become one among the many.
Dream not to alter this.
Is not love a divinity, because it is immortal?
Did not I appear sanctified, even to myself, because this love had for its temple my heart?
I have gazed on you as you slept, melted even to tears, as the idea filled my mind, that all I possessed lay cradled in those idolized, but mortal lineaments before me.
Yet, even then, I have checked thick-coming fears with one thought; I would not fear death, for the emotions that linked us must be immortal.
"And now I do not fear death.
I should be well pleased to close my eyes, never more to open them again.
And yet I fear it; even as I fear all things; for in any state of being linked by the chain of memory with this, happiness would not return--even in Paradise, I must feel that your love was less enduring than the mortal beatings of my fragile heart, every
No--no--me miserable; for love extinct there is no resurrection!
"Yet I love you.
Yet, and for ever, would I contribute all I possess to your welfare.
On account of a tattling world; for the sake of my--of our child, I would remain by you, Raymond, share your fortunes, partake your counsel.
Shall it be thus?
We are no longer lovers; nor can I call myself a friend to any; since, lost as I am, I have no thought to spare from my own wretched, engrossing self.
But it will please me to see you each day!
to listen to the public voice praising you; to keep up your paternal love for our girl; to hear your voice; to know that I am near you, though you are no longer mine.
"If you wish to break the chains that bind us, say the word, and it shall be done--I will take all the blame on myself, of harshness or unkindness, in the world's eye.
"Yet, as I have said, I should be best pleased, at least for the present, to live under the same roof with you.
When the fever of my young life is spent; when placid age shall tame the vulture that devours me, friendship may come, love and hope being dead.
May this be true?
Can my soul, inextricably linked to this perishable frame, become lethargic and cold, even as this sensitive mechanism shall lose its youthful elasticity?
Then, with lack-lustre eyes, grey hairs, and wrinkled brow, though now the words sound hollow and meaningless, then, tottering on the grave's extreme edge, I may be--your affectionate and true friend, "PERDITA".
Raymond's answer was brief.
What indeed could he reply to her complaints, to her griefs which she jealously paled round, keeping out all thought of remedy.
"Notwithstanding your bitter letter," he wrote, "for bitter I must call it, you are the chief person in my estimation, and it is your happiness that I would principally consult.
Do that which seems best to you: and if you can receive gratification from one mode of life in preference to another, do not let me be any obstacle.
I foresee that the plan which you mark out in your letter will not endure long; but you are mistress of yourself, and it is my sincere wish to contribute as far as you will permit me to your happiness".
"Raymond has prophesied well," said Perdita, "alas, that it should be so!
our present mode of life cannot continue long, yet I will not be the first to propose alteration.
He beholds in me one whom he has injured even unto death; and I derive no hope from his kindness; no change can possibly be brought about even by his best intentions.
As well might Cleopatra have worn as an ornament the vinegar which contained her dissolved pearl, as I be content with the love that Raymond can now offer me".
I own that I did not see her misfortune with the same eyes as Perdita.
At all events methought that the wound could be healed; and, if they remained together, it would be so.
I endeavoured therefore to sooth and soften her mind; and it was not until after many endeavours that I gave up the task as impracticable.
Perdita listened to me impatiently, and answered with some asperity:--"Do you think that any of your arguments are new to me?
or that my own burning wishes and intense anguish have not suggested them all a thousand times, with far more eagerness and subtlety than you can put into them?
Lionel, you cannot understand what woman's love is.
In days of happiness I have often repeated to myself, with a grateful heart and exulting spirit, all that Raymond sacrificed for me.
I was a poor, uneducated, unbefriended, mountain girl, raised from nothingness by him.
All that I possessed of the luxuries of life came from him.
He gave me an illustrious name and noble station; the world's respect reflected from his own glory: all this joined to his own undying love, inspired me with sensations towards him, akin to those with which we regard the Giver of life.
I gave him love only.
I devoted myself to him: imperfect creature that I was, I took myself to task, that I might become worthy of him.
I watched over my hasty temper, subdued my burning impatience of character, schooled my self-engrossing thoughts, educating myself to the best perfection I might attain, that the fruit of my exertions might be his happiness.
I took no merit to myself for this.
He deserved it all--all labour, all devotion, all sacrifice; I would have toiled up a scaleless Alp, to pluck a flower that would please him.
I was ready to quit you all, my beloved and gifted companions, and to live only with him, for him.
I could not do otherwise, even if I had wished; for if we are said to have two souls, he was my better soul, to which the other was a perpetual slave.
One only return did he owe me, even fidelity.
I earned that; I deserved it.
Because I was mountain bred, unallied to the noble and wealthy, shall he think to repay me by an empty name and station?
Let him take them back; without his love they are nothing to me.
Their only merit in my eyes was that they were his".
Thus passionately Perdita ran on.
When I adverted to the question of their entire separation, she replied: "Be it so!
One day the period will arrive; I know it, and feel it.
But in this I am a coward.
This imperfect companionship, and our masquerade of union, are strangely dear to me.
It is painful, I allow, destructive, impracticable.
It keeps up a perpetual fever in my veins; it frets my immedicable wound; it is instinct with poison.
Yet I must cling to it; perhaps it will kill me soon, and thus perform a thankful office".
In the mean time, Raymond had remained with Adrian and Idris.
He was naturally frank; the continued absence of Perdita and myself became remarkable; and Raymond soon found relief from the constraint of months, by an unreserved confidence with his two friends.
He related to them the situation in which he had found Evadne.
At first, from delicacy to Adrian he concealed her name; but it was divulged in the course of his narrative, and her former lover heard with the most acute agitation the history of her sufferings.
Idris had shared Perdita's ill opinion of the Greek; but Raymond's account softened and interested her.
Evadne's constancy, fortitude, even her ill-fated and ill-regulated love, were matter of admiration and pity; especially when, from the detail of the events of the nineteenth of October, it was apparent that she preferred suffering and death to any in her
Her subsequent conduct did not diminish this interest.
At first, relieved from famine and the grave, watched over by Raymond with the tenderest assiduity, with that feeling of repose peculiar to convalescence, Evadne gave herself up to rapturous gratitude and love.
But reflection returned with health.
She questioned him with regard to the motives which had occasioned his critical absence.
She framed her enquiries with Greek subtlety; she formed her conclusions with the decision and firmness peculiar to her disposition.
She could not divine, that the breach which she had occasioned between Raymond and Perdita was already irreparable: but she knew, that under the present system it would be widened each day, and that its result must be to destroy her lover's happiness, and
From the moment that she perceived the right line of conduct, she resolved to adopt it, and to part from Raymond for ever.
Conflicting passions, long-cherished love, and self-inflicted disappointment, made her regard death alone as sufficient refuge for her woe.
But the same feelings and opinions which had before restrained her, acted with redoubled force; for she knew that the reflection that he had occasioned her death, would pursue Raymond through life, poisoning every enjoyment, clouding every prospect.
Besides, though the violence of her anguish made life hateful, it had not yet produced that monotonous, lethargic sense of changeless misery which for the most part produces suicide.
Her energy of character induced her still to combat with the ills of life; even those attendant on hopeless love presented themselves, rather in the shape of an adversary to be overcome, than of a victor to whom she must submit.
Besides, she had memories of past tenderness to cherish, smiles, words, and even tears, to con over, which, though remembered in desertion and sorrow, were to be preferred to the forgetfulness of the grave.
It was impossible to guess at the whole of her plan.
Her letter to Raymond gave no clue for discovery; it assured him, that she was in no danger of wanting the means of life; she promised in it to preserve herself, and some future day perhaps to present herself to him in a station not unworthy of her.
She then bade him, with the eloquence of despair and of unalterable love, a last farewell.
All these circumstances were now related to Adrian and Idris.
Raymond then lamented the cureless evil of his situation with Perdita.
He declared, notwithstanding her harshness, he even called it coldness, that he loved her.
He had been ready once with the humility of a penitent, and the duty of a vassal, to surrender himself to her; giving up his very soul to her tutelage, to become her pupil, her slave, her bondsman.
She had rejected these advances; and the time for such exuberant submission, which must be founded on love and nourished by it, was now passed.
Still all his wishes and endeavours were directed towards her peace, and his chief discomfort arose from the perception that he exerted himself in vain.
If she were to continue inflexible in the line of conduct she now pursued, they must part.
The combinations and occurrences of this senseless mode of intercourse were maddening to him.
Yet he would not propose the separation.
He was haunted by the fear of causing the death of one or other of the beings implicated in these events; and he could not persuade himself to undertake to direct the course of events, lest, ignorant of the land he traversed, he should lead those attached
After a discussion on this subject, which lasted for several hours, he took leave of his friends, and returned to town, unwilling to meet Perdita before us, conscious, as we all must be, of the thoughts uppermost in the minds of both.
Perdita prepared to follow him with her child.
Idris endeavoured to persuade her to remain.
My poor sister looked at the counsellor with affright.
She knew that Raymond had conversed with her; had he instigated this request?
--was this to be the prelude to their eternal separation?
--I have said, that the defects of her character awoke and acquired vigour from her unnatural position.
She regarded with suspicion the invitation of Idris; she embraced me, as if she were about to be deprived of my affection also: calling me her more than brother, her only friend, her last hope, she pathetically conjured me not to cease to love her; and
The scenes that followed, convinced her that she had not yet fathomed the obscure gulph into which she had plunged.
Her unhappiness assumed every day a new shape; every day some unexpected event seemed to close, while in fact it led onward, the train of calamities which now befell her.
The selected passion of the soul of Raymond was ambition.
Readiness of talent, a capacity of entering into, and leading the dispositions of men; earnest desire of distinction were the awakeners and nurses of his ambition.
But other ingredients mingled with these, and prevented him from becoming the calculating, determined character, which alone forms a successful hero.
He was obstinate, but not firm; benevolent in his first movements; harsh and reckless when provoked.
Above all, he was remorseless and unyielding in the pursuit of any object of desire, however lawless.
Love of pleasure, and the softer sensibilities of our nature, made a prominent part of his character, conquering the conqueror; holding him in at the moment of acquisition; sweeping away ambition's web; making him forget the toil of weeks, for the sake of
Obeying these impulses, he had become the husband of Perdita: egged on by them, he found himself the lover of Evadne.
He had now lost both.
He had neither the ennobling self-gratulation, which constancy inspires, to console him, nor the voluptuous sense of abandonment to a forbidden, but intoxicating passion.
His heart was exhausted by the recent events; his enjoyment of life was destroyed by the resentment of Perdita, and the flight of Evadne; and the inflexibility of the former, set the last seal upon the annihilation of his hopes.
As long as their disunion remained a secret, he cherished an expectation of re-awakening past tenderness in her bosom; now that we were all made acquainted with these occurrences, and that Perdita, by declaring her resolves to others, in a manner pledged
He made a vow against love and its train of struggles, disappointment and remorse, and sought in mere sensual enjoyment, a remedy for the injurious inroads of passion.
Debasement of character is the certain follower of such pursuits.
Yet this consequence would not have been immediately remarkable, if Raymond had continued to apply himself to the execution of his plans for the public benefit, and the fulfilling his duties as Protector.
But, extreme in all things, given up to immediate impressions, he entered with ardour into this new pursuit of pleasure, and followed up the incongruous intimacies occasioned by it without reflection or foresight.
The council-chamber was deserted; the crowds which attended on him as agents to his various projects were neglected.
Festivity, and even libertinism, became the order of the day.
Perdita beheld with affright the encreasing disorder.
For a moment she thought that she could stem the torrent, and that Raymond could be induced to hear reason from her.
--Vain hope!
The moment of her influence was passed.
He listened with haughtiness, replied disdainfully; and, if in truth, she succeeded in awakening his conscience, the sole effect was that he sought an opiate for the pang in oblivious riot.
With the energy natural to her, Perdita then endeavoured to supply his place.
Their still apparent union permitted her to do much; but no woman could, in the end, present a remedy to the encreasing negligence of the Protector; who, as if seized with a paroxysm of insanity, trampled on all ceremony, all order, all duty, and gave
Reports of these strange proceedings reached us, and we were undecided what method to adopt to restore our friend to himself and his country, when Perdita suddenly appeared among us.
She detailed the progress of the mournful change, and entreated Adrian and myself to go up to London, and endeavour to remedy the encreasing evil:--"Tell him," she cried, "tell Lord Raymond, that my presence shall no longer annoy him.
That he need not plunge into this destructive dissipation for the sake of disgusting me, and causing me to fly.
This purpose is now accomplished; he will never see me more.
But let me, it is my last entreaty, let me in the praises of his countrymen and the prosperity of England, find the choice of my youth justified".
During our ride up to town, Adrian and I discussed and argued upon Raymond's conduct, and his falling off from the hopes of permanent excellence on his part, which he had before given us cause to entertain.
My friend and I had both been educated in one school, or rather I was his pupil in the opinion, that steady adherence to principle was the only road to honour; a ceaseless observance of the laws of general utility, the only conscientious aim of human
But though we both entertained these ideas, we differed in their application.
Resentment added also a sting to my censure; and I reprobated Raymond's conduct in severe terms.
Adrian was more benign, more considerate.
He admitted that the principles that I laid down were the best; but he denied that they were the only ones.
Quoting the text, there are many mansions in my father's house, he insisted that the modes of becoming good or great, varied as much as the dispositions of men, of whom it might be said, as of the leaves of the forest, there were no two alike.
We arrived in London at about eleven at night.
We conjectured, notwithstanding what we had heard, that we should find Raymond in St. Stephen's: thither we sped.
The chamber was full--but there was no Protector; and there was an austere discontent manifest on the countenances of the leaders, and a whispering and busy tattle among the underlings, not less ominous.
We hastened to the palace of the Protectorate.
We found Raymond in his dining room with six others: the bottle was being pushed about merrily, and had made considerable inroads on the understanding of one or two.
He who sat near Raymond was telling a story, which convulsed the rest with laughter.
Raymond sat among them, though while he entered into the spirit of the hour, his natural dignity never forsook him.
He was gay, playful, fascinating--but never did he overstep the modesty of nature, or the respect due to himself, in his wildest sallies.
Yet I own, that considering the task which Raymond had taken on himself as Protector of England, and the cares to which it became him to attend, I was exceedingly provoked to observe the worthless fellows on whom his time was wasted, and the jovial if not
I stood watching the scene, while Adrian flitted like a shadow in among them, and, by a word and look of sobriety, endeavoured to restore order in the assembly.
Raymond expressed himself delighted to see him, declaring that he should make one in the festivity of the night.
This action of Adrian provoked me.
I was indignant that he should sit at the same table with the companions of Raymond--men of abandoned characters, or rather without any, the refuse of high-bred luxury, the disgrace of their country.
"Let me entreat Adrian," I cried, "not to comply: rather join with me in endeavouring to withdraw Lord Raymond from this scene, and restore him to other society".
"My good fellow," said Raymond, "this is neither the time nor place for the delivery of a moral lecture: take my word for it that my amusements and society are not so bad as you imagine.
We are neither hypocrites or fools --for the rest, 'Dost thou think because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?
'" I turned angrily away: "Verney," said Adrian, "you are very cynical: sit down; or if you will not, perhaps, as you are not a frequent visitor, Lord Raymond will humour you, and accompany us, as we had previously agreed upon, to parliament".
Raymond looked keenly at him; he could read benignity only in his gentle lineaments; he turned to me, observing with scorn my moody and stern demeanour.
"Come," said Adrian, "I have promised for you, enable me to keep my engagement.
Come with us".
--Raymond made an uneasy movement, and laconically replied--"I won't"!
The party in the mean time had broken up.
They looked at the pictures, strolled into the other apartments, talked of billiards, and one by one vanished.
Raymond strode angrily up and down the room.
I stood ready to receive and reply to his reproaches.
Adrian leaned against the wall.
"This is infinitely ridiculous," he cried, "if you were school-boys, you could not conduct yourselves more unreasonably".
"You do not understand," said Raymond.
"This is only part of a system:--a scheme of tyranny to which I will never submit.
Because I am Protector of England, am I to be the only slave in its empire?
My privacy invaded, my actions censured, my friends insulted?
But I will get rid of the whole together.
--Be you witnesses," and he took the star, insignia of office, from his breast, and threw it on the table.
"I renounce my office, I abdicate my power--assume it who will"!
--- "Let him assume it," exclaimed Adrian, "who can pronounce himself, or whom the world will pronounce to be your superior.
There does not exist the man in England with adequate presumption.
Know yourself, Raymond, and your indignation will cease; your complacency return.
A few months ago, whenever we prayed for the prosperity of our country, or our own, we at the same time prayed for the life and welfare of the Protector, as indissolubly linked to it.
Your hours were devoted to our benefit, your ambition was to obtain our commendation.
You decorated our towns with edifices, you bestowed on us useful establishments, you gifted the soil with abundant fertility.
The powerful and unjust cowered at the steps of your judgment-seat, and the poor and oppressed arose like morn-awakened flowers under the sunshine of your protection.
"Can you wonder that we are all aghast and mourn, when this appears changed?
But, come, this splenetic fit is already passed; resume your functions; your partizans will hail you; your enemies be silenced; our love, honour, and duty will again be manifested towards you.
Master yourself, Raymond, and the world is subject to you".
"All this would be very good sense, if addressed to another," replied Raymond, moodily, "con the lesson yourself, and you, the first peer of the land, may become its sovereign.
You the good, the wise, the just, may rule all hearts.
But I perceive, too soon for my own happiness, too late for England's good, that I undertook a task to which I am unequal.
I cannot rule myself.
My passions are my masters; my smallest impulse my tyrant.
Do you think that I renounced the Protectorate (and I have renounced it) in a fit of spleen?
By the God that lives, I swear never to take up that bauble again; never again to burthen myself with the weight of care and misery, of which that is the visible sign.
"Once I desired to be a king.
It was in the hey-day of youth, in the pride of boyish folly.
I knew myself when I renounced it.
I renounced it to gain --no matter what--for that also I have lost.
For many months I have submitted to this mock majesty--this solemn jest.
I am its dupe no longer.
I will be free.
"I have lost that which adorned and dignified my life; that which linked me to other men.
Again I am a solitary man; and I will become again, as in my early years, a wanderer, a soldier of fortune.
My friends, for Verney, I feel that you are my friend, do not endeavour to shake my resolve.
Perdita, wedded to an imagination, careless of what is behind the veil, whose charactery is in truth faulty and vile, Perdita has renounced me.
With her it was pretty enough to play a sovereign's part; and, as in the recesses of your beloved forest we acted masques, and imagined ourselves Arcadian shepherds, to please the fancy of the moment--so was I content, more for Perdita's sake than my own,
This was to be the colour; love and confidence the substance of our existence.
But we must live, and not act our lives; pursuing the shadow, I lost the reality--now I renounce both.
"Adrian, I am about to return to Greece, to become again a soldier, perhaps a conqueror.
Will you accompany me?
You will behold new scenes; see a new people; witness the mighty struggle there going forward between civilization and barbarism; behold, and perhaps direct the efforts of a young and vigorous population, for liberty and order.
Come with me.
I have expected you.
I waited for this moment; all is prepared;--will you accompany me"?
"I will," replied Adrian.
"Immediately"?
"To-morrow if you will".
"Reflect"!
I cried.
"Wherefore"?
asked Raymond--"My dear fellow, I have done nothing else than reflect on this step the live-long summer; and be assured that Adrian has condensed an age of reflection into this little moment.
Do not talk of reflection; from this moment I abjure it; this is my only happy moment during a long interval of time.
I must go, Lionel--the Gods will it; and I must.
Do not endeavour to deprive me of my companion, the out-cast's friend.
"One word more concerning unkind, unjust Perdita.
For a time, I thought that, by watching a complying moment, fostering the still warm ashes, I might relume in her the flame of love.
It is more cold within her, than a fire left by gypsies in winter-time, the spent embers crowned by a pyramid of snow.
Then, in endeavouring to do violence to my own disposition, I made all worse than before.
Still I think, that time, and even absence, may restore her to me.
Remember, that I love her still, that my dearest hope is that she will again be mine.
I know, though she does not, how false the veil is which she has spread over the reality--do not endeavour to rend this deceptive covering, but by degrees withdraw it.
Present her with a mirror, in which she may know herself; and, when she is an adept in that necessary but difficult science, she will wonder at her present mistake, and hasten to restore to me, what is by right mine, her forgiveness, her kind thoughts, her
CHAPTER X. AFTER these events, it was long before we were able to attain any degree of composure.
A moral tempest had wrecked our richly freighted vessel, and we, remnants of the diminished crew, were aghast at the losses and changes which we had undergone.
Idris passionately loved her brother, and could ill brook an absence whose duration was uncertain; his society was dear and necessary to me--I had followed up my chosen literary occupations with delight under his tutorship and assistance; his mild
Deeper grief oppressed Perdita.
In spite of resentment, by day and night she figured to herself the toils and dangers of the wanderers.
Raymond absent, struggling with difficulties, lost to the power and rank of the Protectorate, exposed to the perils of war, became an object of anxious interest; not that she felt any inclination to recall him, if recall must imply a return to their former
Such return she felt to be impossible; and while she believed it to be thus, and with anguish regretted that so it should be, she continued angry and impatient with him, who occasioned her misery.
These perplexities and regrets caused her to bathe her pillow with nightly tears, and to reduce her in person and in mind to the shadow of what she had been.
She sought solitude, and avoided us when in gaiety and unrestrained affection we met in a family circle.
Lonely musings, interminable wanderings, and solemn music were her only pastimes.
She neglected even her child; shutting her heart against all tenderness, she grew reserved towards me, her first and fast friend.
I could not see her thus lost, without exerting myself to remedy the evil --remediless I knew, if I could not in the end bring her to reconcile herself to Raymond.
Before he went I used every argument, every persuasion to induce her to stop his journey.
She answered the one with a gush of tears--telling me that to be persuaded--life and the goods of life were a cheap exchange.
It was not will that she wanted, but the capacity; again and again she declared, it were as easy to enchain the sea, to put reins on the wind's viewless courses, as for her to take truth for falsehood, deceit for honesty, heartless communion for sincere,
She answered my reasonings more briefly, declaring with disdain, that the reason was hers; and, until I could persuade her that the past could be unacted, that maturity could go back to the cradle, and that all that was could become as though it had never
And thus with stern pride she suffered him to go, though her very heart-strings cracked at the fulfilling of the act, which rent from her all that made life valuable.
To change the scene for her, and even for ourselves, all unhinged by the cloud that had come over us, I persuaded my two remaining companions that it were better that we should absent ourselves for a time from Windsor.
We visited the north of England, my native Ulswater, and lingered in scenes dear from a thousand associations.
We lengthened our tour into Scotland, that we might see Loch Katrine and Loch Lomond; thence we crossed to Ireland, and passed several weeks in the neighbourhood of Killarney.
The change of scene operated to a great degree as I expected; after a year's absence, Perdita returned in gentler and more docile mood to Windsor.
The first sight of this place for a time unhinged her.
Here every spot was distinct with associations now grown bitter.
The forest glades, the ferny dells, and lawny uplands, the cultivated and cheerful country spread around the silver pathway of ancient Thames, all earth, air, and wave, took up one choral voice, inspired by memory, instinct with plaintive regret.
But my essay towards bringing her to a saner view of her own situation, did not end here.
Perdita was still to a great degree uneducated.
When first she left her peasant life, and resided with the elegant and cultivated Evadne, the only accomplishment she brought to any perfection was that of painting, for which she had a taste almost amounting to genius.
This had occupied her in her lonely cottage, when she quitted her Greek friend's protection.
Her pallet and easel were now thrown aside; did she try to paint, thronging recollections made her hand tremble, her eyes fill with tears.
With this occupation she gave up almost every other; and her mind preyed upon itself almost to madness.
For my own part, since Adrian had first withdrawn me from my selvatic wilderness to his own paradise of order and beauty, I had been wedded to literature.
I felt convinced that however it might have been in former times, in the present stage of the world, no man's faculties could be developed, no man's moral principle be enlarged and liberal, without an extensive acquaintance with books.
To me they stood in the place of an active career, of ambition, and those palpable excitements necessary to the multitude.
The collation of philosophical opinions, the study of historical facts, the acquirement of languages, were at once my recreation, and the serious aim of my life.
I turned author myself.
My productions however were sufficiently unpretending; they were confined to the biography of favourite historical characters, especially those whom I believed to have been traduced, or about whom clung obscurity and doubt.
As my authorship increased, I acquired new sympathies and pleasures.
I found another and a valuable link to enchain me to my fellow-creatures; my point of sight was extended, and the inclinations and capacities of all human beings became deeply interesting to me.
Kings have been called the fathers of their people.
Suddenly I became as it were the father of all mankind.
Posterity became my heirs.
My thoughts were gems to enrich the treasure house of man's intellectual possessions; each sentiment was a precious gift I bestowed on them.
Let not these aspirations be attributed to vanity.
They were not expressed in words, nor even reduced to form in my own mind; but they filled my soul, exalting my thoughts, raising a glow of enthusiasm, and led me out of the obscure path in which I before walked, into the bright noon-enlightened highway of
No one certainly ever enjoyed the pleasures of composition more intensely than I. If I left the woods, the solemn music of the waving branches, and the majestic temple of nature, I sought the vast halls of the Castle, and looked over wide, fertile England,
At such times solemn harmonies or spirit-stirring airs gave wings to my lagging thoughts, permitting them, methought, to penetrate the last veil of nature and her God, and to display the highest beauty in visible expression to the understandings of men.
As the music went on, my ideas seemed to quit their mortal dwelling house; they shook their pinions and began a flight, sailing on the placid current of thought, filling the creation with new glory, and rousing sublime imagery that else had slept
Then I would hasten to my desk, weave the new-found web of mind in firm texture and brilliant colours, leaving the fashioning of the material to a calmer moment.
But this account, which might as properly belong to a former period of my life as to the present moment, leads me far afield.
It was the pleasure I took in literature, the discipline of mind I found arise from it, that made me eager to lead Perdita to the same pursuits.
I began with light hand and gentle allurement; first exciting her curiosity, and then satisfying it in such a way as might occasion her, at the same time that she half forgot her sorrows in occupation, to find in the hours that succeeded a reaction of
Intellectual activity, though not directed towards books, had always been my sister's characteristic.
It had been displayed early in life, leading her out to solitary musing among her native mountains, causing her to form innumerous combinations from common objects, giving strength to her perceptions, and swiftness to their arrangement.
Love had come, as the rod of the master-prophet, to swallow up every minor propensity.
Love had doubled all her excellencies, and placed a diadem on her genius.
Was she to cease to love?
Take the colours and odour from the rose, change the sweet nutriment of mother's milk to gall and poison; as easily might you wean Perdita from love.
She grieved for the loss of Raymond with an anguish, that exiled all smile from her lips, and trenched sad lines on her brow of beauty.
But each day seemed to change the nature of her suffering, and every succeeding hour forced her to alter (if so I may style it) the fashion of her soul's mourning garb.
For a time music was able to satisfy the cravings of her mental hunger, and her melancholy thoughts renewed themselves in each change of key, and varied with every alteration in the strain.
My schooling first impelled her towards books; and, if music had been the food of sorrow, the productions of the wise became its medicine.
The acquisition of unknown languages was too tedious an occupation, for one who referred every expression to the universe within, and read not, as many do, for the mere sake of filling up time; but who was still questioning herself and her author, moulding
She sought to improve her understanding; mechanically her heart and dispositions became soft and gentle under this benign discipline.
After awhile she discovered, that amidst all her newly acquired knowledge, her own character, which formerly she fancied that she thoroughly understood, became the first in rank among the terrae incognitae, the pathless wilds of a country that had no
Erringly and strangely she began the task of self-examination with self-condemnation.
And then again she became aware of her own excellencies, and began to balance with juster scales the shades of good and evil.
I, who longed beyond words, to restore her to the happiness it was still in her power to enjoy, watched with anxiety the result of these internal proceedings.
But man is a strange animal.
We cannot calculate on his forces like that of an engine; and, though an impulse draw with a forty-horse power at what appears willing to yield to one, yet in contempt of calculation the movement is not effected.
Neither grief, philosophy, nor love could make Perdita think with mildness of the dereliction of Raymond.
She now took pleasure in my society; towards Idris she felt and displayed a full and affectionate sense of her worth--she restored to her child in abundant measure her tenderness and care.
But I could discover, amidst all her repinings, deep resentment towards Raymond, and an unfading sense of injury, that plucked from me my hope, when I appeared nearest to its fulfilment.
Among other painful restrictions, she has occasioned it to become a law among us, never to mention Raymond's name before her.
She refused to read any communications from Greece, desiring me only to mention when any arrived, and whether the wanderers were well.
It was curious that even little Clara observed this law towards her mother.
This lovely child was nearly eight years of age.
Formerly she had been a light-hearted infant, fanciful, but gay and childish.
After the departure of her father, thought became impressed on her young brow.
Children, unadepts in language, seldom find words to express their thoughts, nor could we tell in what manner the late events had impressed themselves on her mind.
But certainly she had made deep observations while she noted in silence the changes that passed around her.
She never mentioned her father to Perdita, she appeared half afraid when she spoke of him to me, and though I tried to draw her out on the subject, and to dispel the gloom that hung about her ideas concerning him, I could not succeed.
Yet each foreign post-day she watched for the arrival of letters--knew the post mark, and watched me as I read.
I found her often poring over the article of Greek intelligence in the newspaper.
There is no more painful sight than that of untimely care in children, and it was particularly observable in one whose disposition had heretofore been mirthful.
Yet there was so much sweetness and docility about Clara, that your admiration was excited; and if the moods of mind are calculated to paint the cheek with beauty, and endow motions with grace, surely her contemplations must have been celestial; since
I sometimes expostulated with Perdita on the subject of her reserve; but she rejected my counsels, while her daughter's sensibility excited in her a tenderness still more passionate.
After the lapse of more than a year, Adrian returned from Greece.
When our exiles had first arrived, a truce was in existence between the Turks and Greeks; a truce that was as sleep to the mortal frame, signal of renewed activity on waking.
With the numerous soldiers of Asia, with all of warlike stores, ships, and military engines, that wealth and power could command, the Turks at once resolved to crush an enemy, which creeping on by degrees, had from their stronghold in the Morea, acquired
Greece prepared for a vigorous resistance; it rose to a man; and the women, sacrificing their costly ornaments, accoutred their sons for the war, and bade them conquer or die with the spirit of the Spartan mother.
The talents and courage of Raymond were highly esteemed among the Greeks.
Born at Athens, that city claimed him for her own, and by giving him the command of her peculiar division in the army, the commander-in-chief only possessed superior power.
He was numbered among her citizens, his name was added to the list of Grecian heroes.
His judgment, activity, and consummate bravery, justified their choice.
The Earl of Windsor became a volunteer under his friend.
"It is well," said Adrian, "to prate of war in these pleasant shades, and with much ill-spent oil make a show of joy, because many thousand of our fellow-creatures leave with pain this sweet air and natal earth.
I shall not be suspected of being averse to the Greek cause; I know and feel its necessity; it is beyond every other a good cause.
I have defended it with my sword, and was willing that my spirit should be breathed out in its defence; freedom is of more worth than life, and the Greeks do well to defend their privilege unto death.
But let us not deceive ourselves.
The Turks are men; each fibre, each limb is as feeling as our own, and every spasm, be it mental or bodily, is as truly felt in a Turk's heart or brain, as in a Greek's.
The last action at which I was present was the taking of ----.
The Turks resisted to the last, the garrison perished on the ramparts, and we entered by assault.
Every breathing creature within the walls was massacred.
Think you, amidst the shrieks of violated innocence and helpless infancy, I did not feel in every nerve the cry of a fellow being?
They were men and women, the sufferers, before they were Mahometans, and when they rise turbanless from the grave, in what except their good or evil actions will they be the better or worse than we?
Two soldiers contended for a girl, whose rich dress and extreme beauty excited the brutal appetites of these wretches, who, perhaps good men among their families, were changed by the fury of the moment into incarnated evils.
An old man, with a silver beard, decrepid and bald, he might be her grandfather, interposed to save her; the battle axe of one of them clove his skull.
I rushed to her defence, but rage made them blind and deaf; they did not distinguish my Christian garb or heed my words--words were blunt weapons then, for while war cried "havoc," and murder gave fit echo, how could I-- Turn back the tide of ills,
One of the fellows, enraged at my interference, struck me with his bayonet in the side, and I fell senseless.
"This wound will probably shorten my life, having shattered a frame, weak of itself.
But I am content to die.
I have learnt in Greece that one man, more or less, is of small import, while human bodies remain to fill up the thinned ranks of the soldiery; and that the identity of an individual may be overlooked, so that the muster roll contain its full numbers.
All this has a different effect upon Raymond.
He is able to contemplate the ideal of war, while I am sensible only to its realities.
He is a soldier, a general.
He can influence the blood-thirsty war-dogs, while I resist their propensities vainly.
The cause is simple.
Burke has said that, 'in all bodies those who would lead, must also, in a considerable degree, follow.
' --I cannot follow; for I do not sympathize in their dreams of massacre and glory--to follow and to lead in such a career, is the natural bent of Raymond's mind.
He is always successful, and bids fair, at the same time that he acquires high name and station for himself, to secure liberty, probably extended empire, to the Greeks".
Perdita's mind was not softened by this account.
He, she thought, can be great and happy without me.
Would that I also had a career!
Would that I could freight some untried bark with all my hopes, energies, and desires, and launch it forth into the ocean of life--bound for some attainable point, with ambition or pleasure at the helm!
But adverse winds detain me on shore; like Ulysses, I sit at the water's edge and weep.
But my nerveless hands can neither fell the trees, nor smooth the planks.
Under the influence of these melancholy thoughts, she became more than ever in love with sorrow.
Yet Adrian's presence did some good; he at once broke through the law of silence observed concerning Raymond.
At first she started from the unaccustomed sound; soon she got used to it and to love it, and she listened with avidity to the account of his achievements.
Clara got rid also of her restraint; Adrian and she had been old playfellows; and now, as they walked or rode together, he yielded to her earnest entreaty, and repeated, for the hundredth time, some tale of her father's bravery, munificence, or justice.
Each vessel in the mean time brought exhilarating tidings from Greece.
The presence of a friend in its armies and councils made us enter into the details with enthusiasm; and a short letter now and then from Raymond told us how he was engrossed by the interests of his adopted country.
The Greeks were strongly attached to their commercial pursuits, and would have been satisfied with their present acquisitions, had not the Turks roused them by invasion.
The patriots were victorious; a spirit of conquest was instilled; and already they looked on Constantinople as their own.
Raymond rose perpetually in their estimation; but one man held a superior command to him in their armies.
He was conspicuous for his conduct and choice of position in a battle fought in the plains of Thrace, on the banks of the Hebrus, which was to decide the fate of Islam.
The Mahometans were defeated, and driven entirely from the country west of this river.
The battle was sanguinary, the loss of the Turks apparently irreparable; the Greeks, in losing one man, forgot the nameless crowd strewed upon the bloody field, and they ceased to value themselves on a victory, which cost them-- Raymond.
At the battle of Makri he had led the charge of cavalry, and pursued the fugitives even to the banks of the Hebrus.
His favourite horse was found grazing by the margin of the tranquil river.
It became a question whether he had fallen among the unrecognized; but no broken ornament or stained trapping betrayed his fate.
It was suspected that the Turks, finding themselves possessed of so illustrious a captive, resolved to satisfy their cruelty rather than their avarice, and fearful of the interference of England, had come to the determination of concealing for ever the
Raymond was not forgotten in England.
His abdication of the Protectorate had caused an unexampled sensation; and, when his magnificent and manly system was contrasted with the narrow views of succeeding politicians, the period of his elevation was referred to with sorrow.
The perpetual recurrence of his name, joined to most honourable testimonials, in the Greek gazettes, kept up the interest he had excited.
He seemed the favourite child of fortune, and his untimely loss eclipsed the world, and shewed forth the remnant of mankind with diminished lustre.
They clung with eagerness to the hope held out that he might yet be alive.
Their minister at Constantinople was urged to make the necessary perquisitions, and should his existence be ascertained, to demand his release.
It was to be hoped that their efforts would succeed, and that though now a prisoner, the sport of cruelty and the mark of hate, he would be rescued from danger and restored to the happiness, power, and honour which he deserved.
The effect of this intelligence upon my sister was striking.
She never for a moment credited the story of his death; she resolved instantly to go to Greece.
Reasoning and persuasion were thrown away upon her; she would endure no hindrance, no delay.
It may be advanced for a truth, that, if argument or entreaty can turn any one from a desperate purpose, whose motive and end depends on the strength of the affections only, then it is right so to turn them, since their docility shews, that neither the
If, on the contrary, they are proof against expostulation, this very steadiness is an omen of success; and it becomes the duty of those who love them, to assist in smoothing the obstructions in their path.
Such sentiments actuated our little circle.
Finding Perdita immoveable, we consulted as to the best means of furthering her purpose.
She could not go alone to a country where she had no friends, where she might arrive only to hear the dreadful news, which must overwhelm her with grief and remorse.
Adrian, whose health had always been weak, now suffered considerable aggravation of suffering from the effects of his wound.
Idris could not endure to leave him in this state; nor was it right either to quit or take with us a young family for a journey of this description.
I resolved at length to accompany Perdita.
The separation from my Idris was painful--but necessity reconciled us to it in some degree: necessity and the hope of saving Raymond, and restoring him again to happiness and Perdita.
No delay was to ensue.
Two days after we came to our determination, we set out for Portsmouth, and embarked.
The season was May, the weather stormless; we were promised a prosperous voyage.
Cherishing the most fervent hopes, embarked on the waste ocean, we saw with delight the receding shore of Britain, and on the wings of desire outspeeded our well filled sails towards the South.
The light curling waves bore us onward, and old ocean smiled at the freight of love and hope committed to his charge; it stroked gently its tempestuous plains, and the path was smoothed for us.
Day and night the wind right aft, gave steady impulse to our keel--nor did rough gale, or treacherous sand, or destructive rock interpose an obstacle between my sister and the land which was to restore her to her first beloved, Her dear heart's
VOL.
II.
CHAPTER I. DURING this voyage, when on calm evenings we conversed on deck, watching the glancing of the waves and the changeful appearances of the sky, I discovered the total revolution that the disasters of Raymond had wrought in the mind of my sister.
Were they the same waters of love, which, lately cold and cutting as ice, repelling as that, now loosened from their frozen chains, flowed through the regions of her soul in gushing and grateful exuberance?
She did not believe that he was dead, but she knew that he was in danger, and the hope of assisting in his liberation, and the idea of soothing by tenderness the ills that he might have undergone, elevated and harmonized the late jarring element of her
I was not so sanguine as she as to the result of our voyage.
She was not sanguine, but secure; and the expectation of seeing the lover she had banished, the husband, friend, heart's companion from whom she had long been alienated, wrapt her senses in delight, her mind in placidity.
It was beginning life again; it was leaving barren sands for an abode of fertile beauty; it was a harbour after a tempest, an opiate after sleepless nights, a happy waking from a terrible dream.
Little Clara accompanied us; the poor child did not well understand what was going forward.
She heard that we were bound for Greece, that she would see her father, and now, for the first time, she prattled of him to her mother.
On landing at Athens we found difficulties encrease upon us: nor could the storied earth or balmy atmosphere inspire us with enthusiasm or pleasure, while the fate of Raymond was in jeopardy.
No man had ever excited so strong an interest in the public mind; this was apparent even among the phlegmatic English, from whom he had long been absent.
The Athenians had expected their hero to return in triumph; the women had taught their children to lisp his name joined to thanksgiving; his manly beauty, his courage, his devotion to their cause, made him appear in their eyes almost as one of the ancient
When they spoke of his probable death and certain captivity, tears streamed from their eyes; even as the women of Syria sorrowed for Adonis, did the wives and mothers of Greece lament our English Raymond--Athens was a city of mourning.
All these shews of despair struck Perdita with affright.
With that sanguine but confused expectation, which desire engendered while she was at a distance from reality, she had formed an image in her mind of instantaneous change, when she should set her foot on Grecian shores.
She fancied that Raymond would already be free, and that her tender attentions would come to entirely obliterate even the memory of his mischance.
But his fate was still uncertain; she began to fear the worst, and to feel that her soul's hope was cast on a chance that might prove a blank.
The wife and lovely child of Lord Raymond became objects of intense interest in Athens.
The gates of their abode were besieged, audible prayers were breathed for his restoration; all these circumstances added to the dismay and fears of Perdita.
My exertions were unremitted: after a time I left Athens, and joined the army stationed at Kishan in Thrace.
Bribery, threats, and intrigue, soon discovered the secret that Raymond was alive, a prisoner, suffering the most rigorous confinement and wanton cruelties.
We put in movement every impulse of policy and money to redeem him from their hands.
The impatience of my sister's disposition now returned on her, awakened by repentance, sharpened by remorse.
The very beauty of the Grecian climate, during the season of spring, added torture to her sensations.
The unexampled loveliness of the flower-clad earth--the genial sunshine and grateful shade--the melody of the birds--the majesty of the woods-- the splendour of the marble ruins--the clear effulgence of the stars by night--the combination of all that was
Each long hour was counted, and "He suffers" was the burthen of all her thoughts.
She abstained from food; she lay on the bare earth, and, by such mimickry of his enforced torments, endeavoured to hold communion with his distant pain.
I remembered in one of her harshest moments a quotation of mine had roused her to anger and disdain.
"Perdita," I had said, "some day you will discover that you have done wrong in again casting Raymond on the thorns of life.
When disappointment has sullied his beauty, when a soldier's hardships have bent his manly form, and loneliness made even triumph bitter to him, then you will repent; and regret for the irreparable change "will move In hearts all rocky now, the late
[1] The stinging "remorse of love" now pierced her heart.
She accused herself of his journey to Greece--his dangers--his imprisonment.
She pictured to herself the anguish of his solitude; she remembered with what eager delight he had in former days made her the partner of his joyful hopes-- with what grateful affection he received her sympathy in his cares.
She called to mind how often he had declared that solitude was to him the greatest of all evils, and how death itself was to him more full of fear and pain when he pictured to himself a lonely grave.
"My best girl," he had said, "relieves me from these phantasies.
United to her, cherished in her dear heart, never again shall I know the misery of finding myself alone.
Even if I die before you, my Perdita, treasure up my ashes till yours may mingle with mine.
It is a foolish sentiment for one who is not a materialist, yet, methinks, even in that dark cell, I may feel that my inanimate dust mingles with yours, and thus have a companion in decay".
In her resentful mood, these expressions had been remembered with acrimony and disdain; they visited her in her softened hour, taking sleep from her eyes, all hope of rest from her uneasy mind.
Two months passed thus, when at last we obtained a promise of Raymond's release.
Confinement and hardship had undermined his health; the Turks feared an accomplishment of the threats of the English government, if he died under their hands; they looked upon his recovery as impossible; they delivered him up as a dying man, willingly
He came by sea from Constantinople to Athens.
The wind, favourable to him, blew so strongly in shore, that we were unable, as we had at first intended, to meet him on his watery road.
The watchtower of Athens was besieged by inquirers, each sail eagerly looked out for; till on the first of May the gallant frigate bore in sight, freighted with treasure more invaluable than the wealth which, piloted from Mexico, the vexed Pacific
At early dawn the vessel was discovered bearing in shore; it was conjectured that it would cast anchor about five miles from land.
The news spread through Athens, and the whole city poured out at the gate of the Piraeus, down the roads, through the vineyards, the olive woods and plantations of fig-trees, towards the harbour.
The noisy joy of the populace, the gaudy colours of their dress, the tumult of carriages and horses, the march of soldiers intermixed, the waving of banners and sound of martial music added to the high excitement of the scene; while round us reposed in
To our right the Acropolis rose high, spectatress of a thousand changes, of ancient glory, Turkish slavery, and the restoration of dear-bought liberty; tombs and cenotaphs were strewed thick around, adorned by ever renewing vegetation; the mighty dead
Perdita and Clara rode in a close carriage; I attended them on horseback.
At length we arrived at the harbour; it was agitated by the outward swell of the sea; the beach, as far could be discerned, was covered by a moving multitude, which, urged by those behind toward the sea, again rushed back as the heavy waves with sullen
I applied my glass, and could discern that the frigate had already cast anchor, fearful of the danger of approaching nearer to a lee shore: a boat was lowered; with a pang I saw that Raymond was unable to descend the vessel's side; he was let down in a
I dismounted, and called to some sailors who were rowing about the harbour to pull up, and take me into their skiff; Perdita at the same moment alighted from her carriage--she seized my arm--"Take me with you," she cried; she was trembling and pale; Clara
The little bark to which I had beckoned had now pulled up; before I could stop her, Perdita, assisted by the sailors was in it--Clara followed her mother--a loud shout echoed from the crowd as we pulled out of the inner harbour; while my sister at the
We approached with all the speed six rowers could give; the orderly and picturesque dress of the soldiers on the beach, the sounds of exulting music, the stirring breeze and waving flags, the unchecked exclamations of the eager crowd, whose dark looks and
Trembling, I was unable to continue to look through the glass with which I had watched the motion of the crew, when the frigate's boat had first been launched.
We rapidly drew near, so that at length the number and forms of those within could be discerned; its dark sides grew big, and the splash of its oars became audible: I could distinguish the languid form of my friend, as he half raised himself at our
Perdita's questions had ceased; she leaned on my arm, panting with emotions too acute for tears--our men pulled alongside the other boat.
As a last effort, my sister mustered her strength, her firmness; she stepped from one boat to the other, and then with a shriek she sprang towards Raymond, knelt at his side, and glueing her lips to the hand she seized, her face shrouded by her long hair,
Raymond had somewhat raised himself at our approach, but it was with difficulty that he exerted himself even thus much.
With sunken cheek and hollow eyes, pale and gaunt, how could I recognize the beloved of Perdita?
I continued awe-struck and mute--he looked smilingly on the poor girl; the smile was his.
A day of sun-shine falling on a dark valley, displays its before hidden characteristics; and now this smile, the same with which he first spoke love to Perdita, with which he had welcomed the protectorate, playing on his altered countenance, made me in my
He stretched out to me his other hand; I discerned the trace of manacles on his bared wrist.
I heard my sister's sobs, and thought, happy are women who can weep, and in a passionate caress disburthen the oppression of their feelings; shame and habitual restraint hold back a man.
I would have given worlds to have acted as in days of boyhood, have strained him to my breast, pressed his hand to my lips, and wept over him; my swelling heart choked me; the natural current would not be checked; the big rebellious tears gathered in my
He lay in that blessed calm which convalescence always induces, enjoying in secure tranquillity his liberty and re-union with her whom he adored.
Perdita at length subdued her burst of passion, and rose, --she looked round for Clara; the child frightened, not recognizing her father, and neglected by us, had crept to the other end of the boat; she came at her mother's call.
Perdita presented her to Raymond; her first words were: "Beloved, embrace our child"!
"Come hither, sweet one," said her father, "do you not know me"?
she knew his voice, and cast herself in his arms with half bashful but uncontrollable emotion.
Perceiving the weakness of Raymond, I was afraid of ill consequences from the pressure of the crowd on his landing.
But they were awed as I had been, at the change of his appearance.
The music died away, the shouts abruptly ended; the soldiers had cleared a space in which a carriage was drawn up.
He was placed in it; Perdita and Clara entered with him, and his escort closed round it; a hollow murmur, akin to the roaring of the near waves, went through the multitude; they fell back as the carriage advanced, and fearful of injuring him they had come
The sound of the waves was left behind; that of the multitude continued at intervals, supressed and hoarse; and though, in the city, the houses, churches, and public buildings were decorated with tapestry and banners--though the soldiery lined the streets,
Raymond was weak and exhausted, yet the interest he perceived to be excited on his account, filled him with proud pleasure.
He was nearly killed with kindness.
It is true, the populace retained themselves; but there arose a perpetual hum and bustle from the throng round the palace, which added to the noise of fireworks, the frequent explosion of arms, the tramp to and fro of horsemen and carriages, to which
So we retired awhile to Eleusis, and here rest and tender care added each day to the strength of our invalid.
The zealous attention of Perdita claimed the first rank in the causes which induced his rapid recovery; but the second was surely the delight he felt in the affection and good will of the Greeks.
We are said to love much those whom we greatly benefit.
Raymond had fought and conquered for the Athenians; he had suffered, on their account, peril, imprisonment, and hardship; their gratitude affected him deeply, and he inly vowed to unite his fate for ever to that of a people so enthusiastically devoted to
Social feeling and sympathy constituted a marked feature in my disposition.
In early youth, the living drama acted around me, drew me heart and soul into its vortex.
I was now conscious of a change.
I loved, I hoped, I enjoyed; but there was something besides this.
I was inquisitive as to the internal principles of action of those around me: anxious to read their thoughts justly, and for ever occupied in divining their inmost mind.
All events, at the same time that they deeply interested me, arranged themselves in pictures before me.
I gave the right place to every personage in the groupe, the just balance to every sentiment.
This undercurrent of thought, often soothed me amidst distress, and even agony.
It gave ideality to that, from which, taken in naked truth, the soul would have revolted: it bestowed pictorial colours on misery and disease, and not unfrequently relieved me from despair in deplorable changes.
This faculty, or instinct, was now rouzed.
I watched the re-awakened devotion of my sister; Clara's timid, but concentrated admiration of her father, and Raymond's appetite for renown, and sensitiveness to the demonstrations of affection of the Athenians.
Attentively perusing this animated volume, I was the less surprised at the tale I read on the new-turned page.
The Turkish army were at this time besieging Rodosto; and the Greeks, hastening their preparations, and sending each day reinforcements, were on the eve of forcing the enemy to battle.
Each people looked on the coming struggle as that which would be to a great degree decisive; as, in case of victory, the next step would be the siege of Constantinople by the Greeks.
Raymond, being somewhat recovered, prepared to re-assume his command in the army.
Perdita did not oppose herself to his determination.
She only stipulated to be permitted to accompany him.
She had set down no rule of conduct for herself; but for her life she could not have opposed his slightest wish, or do other than acquiesce cheerfully in all his projects.
One word, in truth, had alarmed her more than battles or sieges, during which she trusted Raymond's high command would exempt him from danger.
That word, as yet it was not more to her, was PLAGUE.
This enemy to the human race had begun early in June to raise its serpent-head on the shores of the Nile; parts of Asia, not usually subject to this evil, were infected.
It was in Constantinople; but as each year that city experienced a like visitation, small attention was paid to those accounts which declared more people to have died there already, than usually made up the accustomed prey of the whole of the hotter
However it might be, neither plague nor war could prevent Perdita from following her lord, or induce her to utter one objection to the plans which he proposed.
To be near him, to be loved by him, to feel him again her own, was the limit of her desires.
The object of her life was to do him pleasure: it had been so before, but with a difference.
In past times, without thought or foresight she had made him happy, being so herself, and in any question of choice, consulted her own wishes, as being one with his.
Now she sedulously put herself out of the question, sacrificing even her anxiety for his health and welfare to her resolve not to oppose any of his desires.
Love of the Greek people, appetite for glory, and hatred of the barbarian government under which he had suffered even to the approach of death, stimulated him.
He wished to repay the kindness of the Athenians, to keep alive the splendid associations connected with his name, and to eradicate from Europe a power which, while every other nation advanced in civilization, stood still, a monument of antique barbarism.
Having effected the reunion of Raymond and Perdita, I was eager to return to England; but his earnest request, added to awakening curiosity, and an indefinable anxiety to behold the catastrophe, now apparently at hand, in the long drawn history of Grecian
As soon as the health of Raymond was sufficiently re-established, he prepared to join the Grecian camp, hear Kishan, a town of some importance, situated to the east of the Hebrus; in which Perdita and Clara were to remain until the event of the expected
We quitted Athens on the 2nd of June.
Raymond had recovered from the gaunt and pallid looks of fever.
If I no longer saw the fresh glow of youth on his matured countenance, if care had besieged his brow, "And dug deep trenches in his beauty's field," if his hair, slightly mingled with grey, and his look, considerate even in its eagerness, gave signs of
The Athenians saw in him, not as heretofore, the heroic boy or desperate man, who was ready to die for them; but the prudent commander, who for their sakes was careful of his life, and could make his own warrior-propensities second to the scheme of conduct
All Athens accompanied us for several miles.
When he had landed a month ago, the noisy populace had been hushed by sorrow and fear; but this was a festival day to all.
The air resounded with their shouts; their picturesque costume, and the gay colours of which it was composed, flaunted in the sunshine; their eager gestures and rapid utterance accorded with their wild appearance.
Raymond was the theme of every tongue, the hope of each wife, mother or betrothed bride, whose husband, child, or lover, making a part of the Greek army, were to be conducted to victory by him.
Notwithstanding the hazardous object of our journey, it was full of romantic interest, as we passed through the vallies, and over the hills, of this divine country.
Raymond was inspirited by the intense sensations of recovered health; he felt that in being general of the Athenians, he filled a post worthy of his ambition; and, in his hope of the conquest of Constantinople, he counted on an event which would be as a
Perdita rested on his restored society, on his love, his hopes and fame, even as a Sybarite on a luxurious couch; every thought was transport, each emotion bathed as it were in a congenial and balmy element.
We arrived at Kishan on the 7th of July.
The weather during our journey had been serene.
Each day, before dawn, we left our night's encampment, and watched the shadows as they retreated from hill and valley, and the golden splendour of the sun's approach.
The accompanying soldiers received, with national vivacity, enthusiastic pleasure from the sight of beautiful nature.
The uprising of the star of day was hailed by triumphant strains, while the birds, heard by snatches, filled up the intervals of the music.
At noon, we pitched our tents in some shady valley, or embowering wood among the mountains, while a stream prattling over pebbles induced grateful sleep.
Our evening march, more calm, was yet more delightful than the morning restlessness of spirit.
If the band played, involuntarily they chose airs of moderated passion; the farewell of love, or lament at absence, was followed and closed by some solemn hymn, which harmonized with the tranquil loveliness of evening, and elevated the soul to grand and
Often all sounds were suspended, that we might listen to the nightingale, while the fire-flies danced in bright measure, and the soft cooing of the aziolo spoke of fair weather to the travellers.
Did we pass a valley?
Soft shades encompassed us, and rocks tinged with beauteous hues.
If we traversed a mountain, Greece, a living map, was spread beneath, her renowned pinnacles cleaving the ether; her rivers threading in silver line the fertile land.
Afraid almost to breathe, we English travellers surveyed with extasy this splendid landscape, so different from the sober hues and melancholy graces of our native scenery.
When we quitted Macedonia, the fertile but low plains of Thrace afforded fewer beauties; yet our journey continued to be interesting.
An advanced guard gave information of our approach, and the country people were quickly in motion to do honour to Lord Raymond.
The villages were decorated by triumphal arches of greenery by day, and lamps by night; tapestry waved from the windows, the ground was strewed with flowers, and the name of Raymond, joined to that of Greece, was echoed in the Evive of the peasant crowd.
When we arrived at Kishan, we learnt, that on hearing of the advance of Lord Raymond and his detachment, the Turkish army had retreated from Rodosto; but meeting with a reinforcement, they had re-trod their steps.
In the meantime, Argyropylo, the Greek commander-in-chief, had advanced, so as to be between the Turks and Rodosto; a battle, it was said, was inevitable.
Perdita and her child were to remain at Kishan.
Raymond asked me, if I would not continue with them.
"Now by the fells of Cumberland," I cried, "by all of the vagabond and poacher that appertains to me, I will stand at your side, draw my sword in the Greek cause, and be hailed as a victor along with you"!
All the plain, from Kishan to Rodosto, a distance of sixteen leagues, was alive with troops, or with the camp-followers, all in motion at the approach of a battle.
The small garrisons were drawn from the various towns and fortresses, and went to swell the main army.
We met baggage waggons, and many females of high and low rank returning to Fairy or Kishan, there to wait the issue of the expected day.
When we arrived at Rodosto, we found that the field had been taken, and the scheme of the battle arranged.
The sound of firing, early on the following morning, informed us that advanced posts of the armies were engaged.
Regiment after regiment advanced, their colours flying and bands playing.
They planted the cannon on the tumuli, sole elevations in this level country, and formed themselves into column and hollow square; while the pioneers threw up small mounds for their protection.
These then were the preparations for a battle, nay, the battle itself; far different from any thing the imagination had pictured.
We read of centre and wing in Greek and Roman history; we fancy a spot, plain as a table, and soldiers small as chessmen; and drawn forth, so that the most ignorant of the game can discover science and order in the disposition of the forces.
When I came to the reality, and saw regiments file off to the left far out of sight, fields intervening between the battalions, but a few troops sufficiently near me to observe their motions, I gave up all idea of understanding, even of seeing a battle,
He shewed himself collected, gallant and imperial; his commands were prompt, his intuition of the events of the day to me miraculous.
In the mean time the cannon roared; the music lifted up its enlivening voice at intervals; and we on the highest of the mounds I mentioned, too far off to observe the fallen sheaves which death gathered into his storehouse, beheld the regiments, now lost
Early in the day, Argyropylo was wounded dangerously, and Raymond assumed the command of the whole army.
He made few remarks, till, on observing through his glass the sequel of an order he had given, his face, clouded for awhile with doubt, became radiant.
"The day is ours," he cried, "the Turks fly from the bayonet".
And then swiftly he dispatched his aides-de-camp to command the horse to fall on the routed enemy.
The defeat became total; the cannon ceased to roar; the infantry rallied, and horse pursued the flying Turks along the dreary plain; the staff of Raymond was dispersed in various directions, to make observations, and bear commands.
Even I was dispatched to a distant part of the field.
The ground on which the battle was fought, was a level plain--so level, that from the tumuli you saw the waving line of mountains on the wide-stretched horizon; yet the intervening space was unvaried by the least irregularity, save such undulations as
The whole of this part of Thrace had been so long a scene of contest, that it had remained uncultivated, and presented a dreary, barren appearance.
The order I had received, was to make an observation of the direction which a detachment of the enemy might have taken, from a northern tumulus; the whole Turkish army, followed by the Greek, had poured eastward; none but the dead remained in the direction
From the top of the mound, I looked far round--all was silent and deserted.
The last beams of the nearly sunken sun shot up from behind the far summit of Mount Athos; the sea of Marmora still glittered beneath its rays, while the Asiatic coast beyond was half hid in a haze of low cloud.
Many a casque, and bayonet, and sword, fallen from unnerved arms, reflected the departing ray; they lay scattered far and near.
From the east, a band of ravens, old inhabitants of the Turkish cemeteries, came sailing along towards their harvest; the sun disappeared.
This hour, melancholy yet sweet, has always seemed to me the time when we are most naturally led to commune with higher powers; our mortal sternness departs, and gentle complacency invests the soul.
But now, in the midst of the dying and the dead, how could a thought of heaven or a sensation of tranquillity possess one of the murderers?
During the busy day, my mind had yielded itself a willing slave to the state of things presented to it by its fellow-beings; historical association, hatred of the foe, and military enthusiasm had held dominion over me.
Now, I looked on the evening star, as softly and calmly it hung pendulous in the orange hues of sunset.
I turned to the corse-strewn earth; and felt ashamed of my species.
So perhaps were the placid skies; for they quickly veiled themselves in mist, and in this change assisted the swift disappearance of twilight usual in the south; heavy masses of cloud floated up from the south east, and red and turbid lightning shot from
Darkness gathered round; the objects about me became indistinct, I descended from my station, and with difficulty guided my horse, so as to avoid the slain.
Suddenly I heard a piercing shriek; a form seemed to rise from the earth; it flew swiftly towards me, sinking to the ground again as it drew near.
All this passed so suddenly, that I with difficulty reined in my horse, so that it should not trample on the prostrate being.
The dress of this person was that of a soldier, but the bared neck and arms, and the continued shrieks discovered a female thus disguised.
I dismounted to her aid, while she, with heavy groans, and her hand placed on her side, resisted my attempt to lead her on.
In the hurry of the moment I forgot that I was in Greece, and in my native accents endeavoured to soothe the sufferer.
With wild and terrific exclamations did the lost, dying Evadne (for it was she) recognize the language of her lover; pain and fever from her wound had deranged her intellects, while her piteous cries and feeble efforts to escape, penetrated me with
In wild delirium she called upon the name of Raymond; she exclaimed that I was keeping him from her, while the Turks with fearful instruments of torture were about to take his life.
Then again she sadly lamented her hard fate; that a woman, with a woman's heart and sensibility, should be driven by hopeless love and vacant hopes to take up the trade of arms, and suffer beyond the endurance of man privation, labour, and pain--the while
As her strength grew less, I lifted her from the ground; her emaciated form hung over my arm, her sunken cheek rested on my breast; in a sepulchral voice she murmured:--"This is the end of love!
--Yet not the end"!
-- and frenzy lent her strength as she cast her arm up to heaven: "there is the end!
there we meet again.
Many living deaths have I borne for thee, O Raymond, and now I expire, thy victim!
--By my death I purchase thee-- lo!
the instruments of war, fire, the plague are my servitors.
I dared, I conquered them all, till now!
I have sold myself to death, with the sole condition that thou shouldst follow me--Fire, and war, and plague, unite for thy destruction--O my Raymond, there is no safety for thee"!
With an heavy heart I listened to the changes of her delirium; I made her a bed of cloaks; her violence decreased and a clammy dew stood on her brow as the paleness of death succeeded to the crimson of fever, I placed her on the cloaks.
She continued to rave of her speedy meeting with her beloved in the grave, of his death nigh at hand; sometimes she solemnly declared that he was summoned; sometimes she bewailed his hard destiny.
Her voice grew feebler, her speech interrupted; a few convulsive movements, and her muscles relaxed, the limbs fell, no more to be sustained, one deep sigh, and life was gone.
I bore her from the near neighbourhood of the dead; wrapt in cloaks, I placed her beneath a tree.
Once more I looked on her altered face; the last time I saw her she was eighteen; beautiful as poet's vision, splendid as a Sultana of the East--Twelve years had past; twelve years of change, sorrow and hardship; her brilliant complexion had become worn
With shuddering horror I veiled this monument of human passion and human misery; I heaped over her all of flags and heavy accoutrements I could find, to guard her from birds and beasts of prey, until I could bestow on her a fitting grave.
Sadly and slowly I stemmed my course from among the heaps of slain, and, guided by the twinkling lights of the town, at length reached Rodosto.

CHAPTER II.
ON my arrival, I found that an order had already gone forth for the army to proceed immediately towards Constantinople; and the troops which had suffered least in the battle were already on their way.
The town was full of tumult.
The wound, and consequent inability of Argyropylo, caused Raymond to be the first in command.
He rode through the town, visiting the wounded, and giving such orders as were necessary for the siege he meditated.
Early in the morning the whole army was in motion.
In the hurry I could hardly find an opportunity to bestow the last offices on Evadne.
Attended only by my servant, I dug a deep grave for her at the foot of the tree, and without disturbing her warrior shroud, I placed her in it, heaping stones upon the grave.
The dazzling sun and glare of daylight, deprived the scene of solemnity; from Evadne's low tomb, I joined Raymond and his staff, now on their way to the Golden City.
Constantinople was invested, trenches dug, and advances made.
The whole Greek fleet blockaded it by sea; on land from the river Kyat Kbanah, near the Sweet Waters, to the Tower of Marmora, on the shores of the Propontis, along the whole line of the ancient walls, the trenches of the siege were drawn.
We already possessed Pera; the Golden Horn itself, the city, bastioned by the sea, and the ivy-mantled walls of the Greek emperors was all of Europe that the Mahometans could call theirs.
Our army looked on her as certain prey.
They counted the garrison; it was impossible that it should be relieved; each sally was a victory; for, even when the Turks were triumphant, the loss of men they sustained was an irreparable injury.
I rode one morning with Raymond to the lofty mound, not far from the Top Kapou, (Cannon-gate), on which Mahmoud planted his standard, and first saw the city.
Still the same lofty domes and minarets towered above the verdurous walls, where Constantine had died, and the Turk had entered the city.
The plain around was interspersed with cemeteries, Turk, Greek, and Armenian, with their growth of cypress trees; and other woods of more cheerful aspect, diversified the scene.
Among them the Greek army was encamped, and their squadrons moved to and fro--now in regular march, now in swift career.
Raymond's eyes were fixed on the city.
"I have counted the hours of her life," said he; "one month, and she falls.
Remain with me till then; wait till you see the cross on St. Sophia; and then return to your peaceful glades".
"You then," I asked, "still remain in Greece"?
"Assuredly," replied Raymond.
"Yet Lionel, when I say this, believe me I look back with regret to our tranquil life at Windsor.
I am but half a soldier; I love the renown, but not the trade of war.
Before the battle of Rodosto I was full of hope and spirit; to conquer there, and afterwards to take Constantinople, was the hope, the bourne, the fulfilment of my ambition.
This enthusiasm is now spent, I know not why; I seem to myself to be entering a darksome gulph; the ardent spirit of the army is irksome to me, the rapture of triumph null".
He paused, and was lost in thought.
His serious mien recalled, by some association, the half-forgotten Evadne to my mind, and I seized this opportunity to make enquiries from him concerning her strange lot.
I asked him, if he had ever seen among the troops any one resembling her; if since he had returned to Greece he had heard of her?
He started at her name,--he looked uneasily on me.
"Even so," he cried, "I knew you would speak of her.
Long, long I had forgotten her.
Since our encampment here, she daily, hourly visits my thoughts.
When I am addressed, her name is the sound I expect: in every communication, I imagine that she will form a part.
At length you have broken the spell; tell me what you know of her".
I related my meeting with her; the story of her death was told and re-told.
With painful earnestness he questioned me concerning her prophecies with regard to him.
I treated them as the ravings of a maniac.
"No, no," he said, "do not deceive yourself,--me you cannot.
She has said nothing but what I knew before--though this is confirmation.
Fire, the sword, and plague!
They may all be found in yonder city; on my head alone may they fall"!
From this day Raymond's melancholy increased.
He secluded himself as much as the duties of his station permitted.
When in company, sadness would in spite of every effort steal over his features, and he sat absent and mute among the busy crowd that thronged about him.
Perdita rejoined him, and before her he forced himself to appear cheerful, for she, even as a mirror, changed as he changed, and if he were silent and anxious, she solicitously inquired concerning, and endeavoured to remove the cause of his seriousness.
She resided at the palace of Sweet Waters, a summer seraglio of the Sultan; the beauty of the surrounding scenery, undefiled by war, and the freshness of the river, made this spot doubly delightful.
Raymond felt no relief, received no pleasure from any show of heaven or earth.
He often left Perdita, to wander in the grounds alone; or in a light shallop he floated idly on the pure waters, musing deeply.
Sometimes I joined him; at such times his countenance was invariably solemn, his air dejected.
He seemed relieved on seeing me, and would talk with some degree of interest on the affairs of the day.
There was evidently something behind all this; yet, when he appeared about to speak of that which was nearest his heart, he would abruptly turn away, and with a sigh endeavour to deliver the painful idea to the winds.
It had often occurred, that, when, as I said, Raymond quitted Perdita's drawing-room, Clara came up to me, and gently drawing me aside, said, "Papa is gone; shall we go to him?
I dare say he will be glad to see you".
And, as accident permitted, I complied with or refused her request.
One evening a numerous assembly of Greek chieftains were gathered together in the palace.
The intriguing Palli, the accomplished Karazza, the warlike Ypsilanti, were among the principal.
They talked of the events of the day; the skirmish at noon; the diminished numbers of the Infidels; their defeat and flight: they contemplated, after a short interval of time, the capture of the Golden City.
They endeavoured to picture forth what would then happen, and spoke in lofty terms of the prosperity of Greece, when Constantinople should become its capital.
The conversation then reverted to Asiatic intelligence, and the ravages the plague made in its chief cities; conjectures were hazarded as to the progress that disease might have made in the besieged city.
Raymond had joined in the former part of the discussion.
In lively terms he demonstrated the extremities to which Constantinople was reduced; the wasted and haggard, though ferocious appearance of the troops; famine and pestilence was at work for them, he observed, and the infidels would soon be obliged to take
Suddenly in the midst of his harangue he broke off, as if stung by some painful thought; he rose uneasily, and I perceived him at length quit the hall, and through the long corridor seek the open air.
He did not return; and soon Clara crept round to me, making the accustomed invitation.
I consented to her request, and taking her little hand, followed Raymond.
We found him just about to embark in his boat, and he readily agreed to receive us as companions.
After the heats of the day, the cooling land-breeze ruffled the river, and filled our little sail.
The city looked dark to the south, while numerous lights along the near shores, and the beautiful aspect of the banks reposing in placid night, the waters keenly reflecting the heavenly lights, gave to this beauteous river a dower of loveliness that might
Our single boatman attended to the sail; Raymond steered; Clara sat at his feet, clasping his knees with her arms, and laying her head on them.
Raymond began the conversation somewhat abruptly.
"This, my friend, is probably the last time we shall have an opportunity of conversing freely; my plans are now in full operation, and my time will become more and more occupied.
Besides, I wish at once to tell you my wishes and expectations, and then never again to revert to so painful a subject.
First, I must thank you, Lionel, for having remained here at my request.
Vanity first prompted me to ask you: vanity, I call it; yet even in this I see the hand of fate--your presence will soon be necessary; you will become the last resource of Perdita, her protector and consoler.
You will take her back to Windsor".
-- "Not without you," I said.
"You do not mean to separate again"?
"Do not deceive yourself," replied Raymond, "the separation at hand is one over which I have no control; most near at hand is it; the days are already counted.
May I trust you?
For many days I have longed to disclose the mysterious presentiments that weigh on me, although I fear that you will ridicule them.
Yet do not, my gentle friend; for, all childish and unwise as they are, they have become a part of me, and I dare not expect to shake them off.
"Yet how can I expect you to sympathize with me?
You are of this world; I am not.
You hold forth your hand; it is even as a part of yourself; and you do not yet divide the feeling of identity from the mortal form that shapes forth Lionel.
How then can you understand me?
Earth is to me a tomb, the firmament a vault, shrouding mere corruption.
Time is no more, for I have stepped within the threshold of eternity; each man I meet appears a corse, which will soon be deserted of its animating spark, on the eve of decay and corruption.
Cada piedra un piramide levanta, y cada flor costruye un monumento, cada edificio es un sepulcro altivo, cada soldado un esqueleto vivo".
[1] His accent was mournful,--he sighed deeply.
"A few months ago," he continued, "I was thought to be dying; but life was strong within me.
My affections were human; hope and love were the day-stars of my life.
Now-- they dream that the brows of the conqueror of the infidel faith are about to be encircled by triumphant laurel; they talk of honourable reward, of title, power, and wealth--all I ask of Greece is a grave.
Let them raise a mound above my lifeless body, which may stand even when the dome of St. Sophia has fallen.
"Wherefore do I feel thus?
At Rodosto I was full of hope; but when first I saw Constantinople, that feeling, with every other joyful one, departed.
The last words of Evadne were the seal upon the warrant of my death.
Yet I do not pretend to account for my mood by any particular event.
All I can say is, that it is so.
The plague I am told is in Constantinople, perhaps I have imbibed its effluvia--perhaps disease is the real cause of my prognostications.
It matters little why or wherefore I am affected, no power can avert the stroke, and the shadow of Fate's uplifted hand already darkens me.
"To you, Lionel, I entrust your sister and her child.
Never mention to her the fatal name of Evadne.
She would doubly sorrow over the strange link that enchains me to her, making my spirit obey her dying voice, following her, as it is about to do, to the unknown country".
I listened to him with wonder; but that his sad demeanour and solemn utterance assured me of the truth and intensity of his feelings, I should with light derision have attempted to dissipate his fears.
Whatever I was about to reply, was interrupted by the powerful emotions of Clara.
Raymond had spoken, thoughtless of her presence, and she, poor child, heard with terror and faith the prophecy of his death.
Her father was moved by her violent grief; he took her in his arms and soothed her, but his very soothings were solemn and fearful.
"Weep not, sweet child," said he, "the coming death of one you have hardly known.
I may die, but in death I can never forget or desert my own Clara.
In after sorrow or joy, believe that you father's spirit is near, to save or sympathize with you.
Be proud of me, and cherish your infant remembrance of me.
Thus, sweetest, I shall not appear to die.
One thing you must promise,--not to speak to any one but your uncle, of the conversation you have just overheard.
When I am gone, you will console your mother, and tell her that death was only bitter because it divided me from her; that my last thoughts will be spent on her.
But while I live, promise not to betray me; promise, my child".
With faltering accents Clara promised, while she still clung to her father in a transport of sorrow.
Soon we returned to shore, and I endeavoured to obviate the impression made on the child's mind, by treating Raymond's fears lightly.
We heard no more of them; for, as he had said, the siege, now drawing to a conclusion, became paramount in interest, engaging all his time and attention.
The empire of the Mahometans in Europe was at its close.
The Greek fleet blockading every port of Stamboul, prevented the arrival of succour from Asia; all egress on the side towards land had become impracticable, except to such desperate sallies, as reduced the numbers of the enemy without making any impression
The garrison was now so much diminished, that it was evident that the city could easily have been carried by storm; but both humanity and policy dictated a slower mode of proceeding.
We could hardly doubt that, if pursued to the utmost, its palaces, its temples and store of wealth would be destroyed in the fury of contending triumph and defeat.
Already the defenceless citizens had suffered through the barbarity of the Janisaries; and, in time of storm, tumult and massacre, beauty, infancy and decrepitude, would have alike been sacrificed to the brutal ferocity of the soldiers.
Famine and blockade were certain means of conquest; and on these we founded our hopes of victory.
Each day the soldiers of the garrison assaulted our advanced posts, and impeded the accomplishment of our works.
Fire-boats were launched from the various ports, while our troops sometimes recoiled from the devoted courage of men who did not seek to live, but to sell their lives dearly.
These contests were aggravated by the season: they took place during summer, when the southern Asiatic wind came laden with intolerable heat, when the streams were dried up in their shallow beds, and the vast basin of the sea appeared to glow under the
Nor did night refresh the earth.
Dew was denied; herbage and flowers there were none; the very trees drooped; and summer assumed the blighted appearance of winter, as it went forth in silence and flame to abridge the means of sustenance to man.
In vain did the eye strive to find the wreck of some northern cloud in the stainless empyrean, which might bring hope of change and moisture to the oppressive and windless atmosphere.
All was serene, burning, annihilating.
We the besiegers were in the comparison little affected by these evils.
The woods around afforded us shade,--the river secured to us a constant supply of water; nay, detachments were employed in furnishing the army with ice, which had been laid up on Haemus, and Athos, and the mountains of Macedonia, while cooling fruits and
But in the city things wore a different face.
The sun's rays were refracted from the pavement and buildings--the stoppage of the public fountains--the bad quality of the food, and scarcity even of that, produced a state of suffering, which was aggravated by the scourge of disease; while the garrison
Still they would not capitulate.
Suddenly the system of warfare was changed.
We experienced no more assaults; and by night and day we continued our labours unimpeded.
Stranger still, when the troops advanced near the city, the walls were vacant, and no cannon was pointed against the intruders.
When these circumstances were reported to Raymond, he caused minute observations to be made as to what was doing within the walls, and when his scouts returned, reporting only the continued silence and desolation of the city, he commanded the army to be
No one appeared on the walls; the very portals, though locked and barred, seemed unguarded; above, the many domes and glittering crescents pierced heaven; while the old walls, survivors of ages, with ivy-crowned tower and weed-tangled buttress, stood as
From within the city neither shout nor cry, nor aught except the casual howling of a dog, broke the noon-day stillness.
Even our soldiers were awed to silence; the music paused; the clang of arms was hushed.
Each man asked his fellow in whispers, the meaning of this sudden peace; while Raymond from an height endeavoured, by means of glasses, to discover and observe the stratagem of the enemy.
No form could be discerned on the terraces of the houses; in the higher parts of the town no moving shadow bespoke the presence of any living being: the very trees waved not, and mocked the stability of architecture with like immovability.
The tramp of horses, distinctly heard in the silence, was at length discerned.
It was a troop sent by Karazza, the Admiral; they bore dispatches to the Lord General.
The contents of these papers were important.
The night before, the watch, on board one of the smaller vessels anchored near the seraglio wall, was roused by a slight splashing as of muffled oars; the alarm was given: twelve small boats, each containing three Janizaries, were descried endeavouring to
When they found themselves discovered they discharged their muskets, and some came to the front to cover the others, whose crews, exerting all their strength, endeavoured to escape with their light barks from among the dark hulls that environed them.
They were in the end all sunk, and, with the exception of two or three prisoners, the crews drowned.
Little could be got from the survivors; but their cautious answers caused it to be surmised that several expeditions had preceded this last, and that several Turks of rank and importance had been conveyed to Asia.
The men disdainfully repelled the idea of having deserted the defence of their city; and one, the youngest among them, in answer to the taunt of a sailor, exclaimed, "Take it, Christian dogs!
take the palaces, the gardens, the mosques, the abode of our fathers--take plague with them; pestilence is the enemy we fly; if she be your friend, hug her to your bosoms.
The curse of Allah is on Stamboul, share ye her fate".
Such was the account sent by Karazza to Raymond: but a tale full of monstrous exaggerations, though founded on this, was spread by the accompanying troop among our soldiers.
A murmur arose, the city was the prey of pestilence; already had a mighty power subjugated the inhabitants; Death had become lord of Constantinople.
I have heard a picture described, wherein all the inhabitants of earth were drawn out in fear to stand the encounter of Death.
The feeble and decrepid fled; the warriors retreated, though they threatened even in flight.
Wolves and lions, and various monsters of the desert roared against him; while the grim Unreality hovered shaking his spectral dart, a solitary but invincible assailant.
Even so was it with the army of Greece.
I am convinced, that had the myriad troops of Asia come from over the Propontis, and stood defenders of the Golden City, each and every Greek would have marched against the overwhelming numbers, and have devoted himself with patriotic fury for his country.
But here no hedge of bayonets opposed itself, no death-dealing artillery, no formidable array of brave soldiers--the unguarded walls afforded easy entrance--the vacant palaces luxurious dwellings; but above the dome of St. Sophia the superstitious Greek
Raymond was actuated by far other feelings.
He descended the hill with a face beaming with triumph, and pointing with his sword to the gates, commanded his troops to--down with those barricades--the only obstacles now to completest victory.
The soldiers answered his cheerful words with aghast and awe-struck looks; instinctively they drew back, and Raymond rode in the front of the lines:--"By my sword I swear," he cried, "that no ambush or stratagem endangers you.
The enemy is already vanquished; the pleasant places, the noble dwellings and spoil of the city are already yours; force the gate; enter and possess the seats of your ancestors, your own inheritance"!
An universal shudder and fearful whispering passed through the lines; not a soldier moved.
"Cowards"!
exclaimed their general, exasperated, "give me an hatchet!
I alone will enter!
I will plant your standard; and when you see it wave from yon highest minaret, you may gain courage, and rally round it"!
One of the officers now came forward: "General," he said, "we neither fear the courage, nor arms, the open attack, nor secret ambush of the Moslems.
We are ready to expose our breasts, exposed ten thousand times before, to the balls and scymetars of the infidels, and to fall gloriously for Greece.
But we will not die in heaps, like dogs poisoned in summer-time, by the pestilential air of that city--we dare not go against the Plague"!
A multitude of men are feeble and inert, without a voice, a leader; give them that, and they regain the strength belonging to their numbers.
Shouts from a thousand voices now rent the air--the cry of applause became universal.
Raymond saw the danger; he was willing to save his troops from the crime of disobedience; for he knew, that contention once begun between the commander and his army, each act and word added to the weakness of the former, and bestowed power on the latter.
He gave orders for the retreat to be sounded, and the regiments repaired in good order to the camp.
I hastened to carry the intelligence of these strange proceedings to Perdita; and we were soon joined by Raymond.
He looked gloomy and perturbed.
My sister was struck by my narrative: "How beyond the imagination of man," she exclaimed, "are the decrees of heaven, wondrous and inexplicable"!
"Foolish girl," cried Raymond angrily, "are you like my valiant soldiers, panic-struck?
What is there inexplicable, pray, tell me, in so very natural an occurrence?
Does not the plague rage each year in Stamboul?
What wonder, that this year, when as we are told, its virulence is unexampled in Asia, that it should have occasioned double havoc in that city?
What wonder then, in time of siege, want, extreme heat, and drought, that it should make unaccustomed ravages?
Less wonder far is it, that the garrison, despairing of being able to hold out longer, should take advantage of the negligence of our fleet to escape at once from siege and capture.
It is not pestilence --by the God that lives!
it is not either plague or impending danger that makes us, like birds in harvest-time, terrified by a scarecrow, abstain from the ready prey--it is base superstition--And thus the aim of the valiant is made the shuttlecock of fools; the worthy ambition of
But yet Stamboul shall be ours!
By my past labours, by torture and imprisonment suffered for them, by my victories, by my sword, I swear--by my hopes of fame, by my former deserts now awaiting their reward, I deeply vow, with these hands to plant the cross on yonder mosque"!
"Dearest Raymond"!
interrupted Perdita, in a supplicating accent.
He had been walking to and fro in the marble hall of the seraglio; his very lips were pale with rage, while, quivering, they shaped his angry words-- his eyes shot fire--his gestures seemed restrained by their very vehemence.
"Perdita," he continued, impatiently, "I know what you would say; I know that you love me, that you are good and gentle; but this is no woman's work--nor can a female heart guess at the hurricane which tears me"!
He seemed half afraid of his own violence, and suddenly quitted the hall: a look from Perdita shewed me her distress, and I followed him.
He was pacing the garden: his passions were in a state of inconceivable turbulence.
"Am I for ever," he cried, "to be the sport of fortune!
Must man, the heaven-climber, be for ever the victim of the crawling reptiles of his species!
Were I as you, Lionel, looking forward to many years of life, to a succession of love-enlightened days, to refined enjoyments and fresh-springing hopes, I might yield, and breaking my General's staff, seek repose in the glades of Windsor.
But I am about to die!
--nay, interrupt me not--soon I shall die.
From the many-peopled earth, from the sympathies of man, from the loved resorts of my youth, from the kindness of my friends, from the affection of my only beloved Perdita, I am about to be removed.
Such is the will of fate!
Such the decree of the High Ruler from whom there is no appeal: to whom I submit.
But to lose all--to lose with life and love, glory also!
It shall not be!
"I, and in a few brief years, all you,--this panic-struck army, and all the population of fair Greece, will no longer be.
But other generations will arise, and ever and for ever will continue, to be made happier by our present acts, to be glorified by our valour.
The prayer of my youth was to be one among those who render the pages of earth's history splendid; who exalt the race of man, and make this little globe a dwelling of the mighty.
Alas, for Raymond!
the prayer of his youth is wasted--the hopes of his manhood are null!
"From my dungeon in yonder city I cried, soon I will be thy lord!
When Evadne pronounced my death, I thought that the title of Victor of Constantinople would be written on my tomb, and I subdued all mortal fear.
I stand before its vanquished walls, and dare not call myself a conqueror.
So shall it not be!
Did not Alexander leap from the walls of the city of the Oxydracae, to shew his coward troops the way to victory, encountering alone the swords of its defenders?
Even so will I brave the plague--and though no man follow, I will plant the Grecian standard on the height of St. Sophia".
Reason came unavailing to such high-wrought feelings.
In vain I shewed him, that when winter came, the cold would dissipate the pestilential air, and restore courage to the Greeks.
"Talk not of other season than this"!
he cried.
"I have lived my last winter, and the date of this year, 2092, will be carved upon my tomb.
Already do I see," he continued, looking up mournfully, "the bourne and precipitate edge of my existence, over which I plunge into the gloomy mystery of the life to come.
I am prepared, so that I leave behind a trail of light so radiant, that my worst enemies cannot cloud it.
I owe this to Greece, to you, to my surviving Perdita, and to myself, the victim of ambition".
We were interrupted by an attendant, who announced, that the staff of Raymond was assembled in the council-chamber.
He requested me in the meantime to ride through the camp, and to observe and report to him the dispositions of the soldiers; he then left me.
I had been excited to the utmost by the proceedings of the day, and now more than ever by the passionate language of Raymond.
Alas!
for human reason!
He accused the Greeks of superstition: what name did he give to the faith he lent to the predictions of Evadne?
I passed from the palace of Sweet Waters to the plain on which the encampment lay, and found its inhabitants in commotion.
The arrival of several with fresh stories of marvels, from the fleet; the exaggerations bestowed on what was already known; tales of old prophecies, of fearful histories of whole regions which had been laid waste during the present year by pestilence,
Discipline was lost; the army disbanded itself.
Each individual, before a part of a great whole moving only in unison with others, now became resolved into the unit nature had made him, and thought of himself only.
They stole off at first by ones and twos, then in larger companies, until, unimpeded by the officers, whole battalions sought the road that led to Macedonia.
About midnight I returned to the palace and sought Raymond; he was alone, and apparently composed; such composure, at least, was his as is inspired by a resolve to adhere to a certain line of conduct.
He heard my account of the self-dissolution of the army with calmness, and then said, "You know, Verney, my fixed determination not to quit this place, until in the light of day Stamboul is confessedly ours.
If the men I have about me shrink from following me, others, more courageous, are to be found.
Go you before break of day, bear these dispatches to Karazza, add to them your own entreaties that he send me his marines and naval force; if I can get but one regiment to second me, the rest would follow of course.
Let him send me this regiment.
I shall expect your return by to-morrow noon".
Methought this was but a poor expedient; but I assured him of my obedience and zeal.
I quitted him to take a few hours rest.
With the breaking of morning I was accoutred for my ride.
I lingered awhile, desirous of taking leave of Perdita, and from my window observed the approach of the sun.
The golden splendour arose, and weary nature awoke to suffer yet another day of heat and thirsty decay.
No flowers lifted up their dew-laden cups to meet the dawn; the dry grass had withered on the plains; the burning fields of air were vacant of birds; the cicale alone, children of the sun, began their shrill and deafening song among the cypresses and
I saw Raymond's coal-black charger brought to the palace gate; a small company of officers arrived soon after; care and fear was painted on each cheek, and in each eye, unrefreshed by sleep.
I found Raymond and Perdita together.
He was watching the rising sun, while with one arm he encircled his beloved's waist; she looked on him, the sun of her life, with earnest gaze of mingled anxiety and tenderness.
Raymond started angrily when he saw me.
"Here still"?
he cried.
"Is this your promised zeal"?
"Pardon me," I said, "but even as you speak, I am gone".
"Nay, pardon me," he replied; "I have no right to command or reproach; but my life hangs on your departure and speedy return.
Farewell"!
His voice had recovered its bland tone, but a dark cloud still hung on his features.
I would have delayed; I wished to recommend watchfulness to Perdita, but his presence restrained me.
I had no pretence for my hesitation; and on his repeating his farewell, I clasped his outstretched hand; it was cold and clammy.
"Take care of yourself, my dear Lord," I said.
"Nay," said Perdita, "that task shall be mine.
Return speedily, Lionel".
With an air of absence he was playing with her auburn locks, while she leaned on him; twice I turned back, only to look again on this matchless pair.
At last, with slow and heavy steps, I had paced out of the hall, and sprung upon my horse.
At that moment Clara flew towards me; clasping my knee she cried, "Make haste back, uncle!
Dear uncle, I have such fearful dreams; I dare not tell my mother.
Do not be long away"!
I assured her of my impatience to return, and then, with a small escort rode along the plain towards the tower of Marmora.
I fulfilled my commission; I saw Karazza.
He was somewhat surprised; he would see, he said, what could be done; but it required time; and Raymond had ordered me to return by noon.
It was impossible to effect any thing in so short a time.
I must stay till the next day; or come back, after having reported the present state of things to the general.
My choice was easily made.
A restlessness, a fear of what was about to betide, a doubt as to Raymond's purposes, urged me to return without delay to his quarters.
Quitting the Seven Towers, I rode eastward towards the Sweet Waters.
I took a circuitous path, principally for the sake of going to the top of the mount before mentioned, which commanded a view of the city.
I had my glass with me.
The city basked under the noon-day sun, and the venerable walls formed its picturesque boundary.
Immediately before me was the Top Kapou, the gate near which Mahomet had made the breach by which he entered the city.
Trees gigantic and aged grew near; before the gate I discerned a crowd of moving human figures--with intense curiosity I lifted my glass to my eye.
I saw Lord Raymond on his charger; a small company of officers had gathered about him; and behind was a promiscuous concourse of soldiers and subalterns, their discipline lost, their arms thrown aside; no music sounded, no banners streamed.
The only flag among them was one which Raymond carried; he pointed with it to the gate of the city.
The circle round him fell back.
With angry gestures he leapt from his horse, and seizing a hatchet that hung from his saddle-bow, went with the apparent intention of battering down the opposing gate.
A few men came to aid him; their numbers increased; under their united blows the obstacle was vanquished, gate, portcullis, and fence were demolished; and the wide sun-lit way, leading to the heart of the city, now lay open before them.
The men shrank back; they seemed afraid of what they had already done, and stood as if they expected some Mighty Phantom to stalk in offended majesty from the opening.
Raymond sprung lightly on his horse, grasped the standard, and with words which I could not hear (but his gestures, being their fit accompaniment, were marked by passionate energy,) he seemed to adjure their assistance and companionship; even as he spoke,
Indignation now transported him; his words I guessed were fraught with disdain--then turning from his coward followers, he addressed himself to enter the city alone.
His very horse seemed to back from the fatal entrance; his dog, his faithful dog, lay moaning and supplicating in his path--in a moment more, he had plunged the rowels into the sides of the stung animal, who bounded forward, and he, the gateway passed, was
Until this moment my soul had been in my eyes only.
I had gazed with wonder, mixed with fear and enthusiasm.
The latter feeling now predominated.
I forgot the distance between us: "I will go with thee, Raymond"!
I cried; but, my eye removed from the glass, I could scarce discern the pigmy forms of the crowd, which about a mile from me surrounded the gate; the form of Raymond was lost.
Stung with impatience, I urged my horse with force of spur and loosened reins down the acclivity, that, before danger could arrive, I might be at the side of my noble, godlike friend.
A number of buildings and trees intervened, when I had reached the plain, hiding the city from my view.
But at that moment a crash was heard.
Thunderlike it reverberated through the sky, while the air was darkened.
A moment more and the old walls again met my sight, while over them hovered a murky cloud; fragments of buildings whirled above, half seen in smoke, while flames burst out beneath, and continued explosions filled the air with terrific thunders.
Flying from the mass of falling ruin which leapt over the high walls, and shook the ivy towers, a crowd of soldiers made for the road by which I came; I was surrounded, hemmed in by them, unable to get forward.
My impatience rose to its utmost; I stretched out my hands to the men; I conjured them to turn back and save their General, the conqueror of Stamboul, the liberator of Greece; tears, aye tears, in warm flow gushed from my eyes--I would not believe in his
Horrible sights were shaped to me in the turbid cloud that hovered over the city; and my only relief was derived from the struggles I made to approach the gate.
Yet when I effected my purpose, all I could discern within the precincts of the massive walls was a city of fire: the open way through which Raymond had ridden was enveloped in smoke and flame.
After an interval the explosions ceased, but the flames still shot up from various quarters; the dome of St. Sophia had disappeared.
Strange to say (the result perhaps of the concussion of air occasioned by the blowing up of the city) huge, white thunder clouds lifted themselves up from the southern horizon, and gathered over-head; they were the first blots on the blue expanse that I
The vault above became obscured, lightning flashed from the heavy masses, followed instantaneously by crashing thunder; then the big rain fell.
The flames of the city bent beneath it; and the smoke and dust arising from the ruins was dissipated.
I no sooner perceived an abatement of the flames than, hurried on by an irresistible impulse, I endeavoured to penetrate the town.
I could only do this on foot, as the mass of ruin was impracticable for a horse.
I had never entered the city before, and its ways were unknown to me.
The streets were blocked up, the ruins smoking; I climbed up one heap, only to view others in succession; and nothing told me where the centre of the town might be, or towards what point Raymond might have directed his course.
The rain ceased; the clouds sunk behind the horizon; it was now evening, and the sun descended swiftly the western sky.
I scrambled on, until I came to a street, whose wooden houses, half-burnt, had been cooled by the rain, and were fortunately uninjured by the gunpowder.
Up this I hurried--until now I had not seen a vestige of man.
Yet none of the defaced human forms which I distinguished, could be Raymond; so I turned my eyes away, while my heart sickened within me.
I came to an open space--a mountain of ruin in the midst, announced that some large mosque had occupied the space--and here, scattered about, I saw various articles of luxury and wealth, singed, destroyed--but shewing what they had been in their
Hours passed, while in this scene of ruin I sought for Raymond.
Insurmountable heaps sometimes opposed themselves; the still burning fires scorched me.
The sun set; the atmosphere grew dim--and the evening star no longer shone companionless.
The glare of flames attested the progress of destruction, while, during mingled light and obscurity, the piles around me took gigantic proportions and weird shapes.
For a moment I could yield to the creative power of the imagination, and for a moment was soothed by the sublime fictions it presented to me.
The beatings of my human heart drew me back to blank reality.
Where, in this wilderness of death, art thou, O Raymond--ornament of England, deliverer of Greece, "hero of unwritten story," where in this burning chaos are thy dear relics strewed?
I called aloud for him--through the darkness of night, over the scorching ruins of fallen Constantinople, his name was heard; no voice replied--echo even was mute.
I was overcome by weariness; the solitude depressed my spirits.
The sultry air impregnated with dust, the heat and smoke of burning palaces, palsied my limbs.
Hunger suddenly came acutely upon me.
The excitement which had hitherto sustained me was lost; as a building, whose props are loosened, and whose foundations rock, totters and falls, so when enthusiasm and hope deserted me, did my strength fail.
I sat on the sole remaining step of an edifice, which even in its downfall, was huge and magnificent; a few broken walls, not dislodged by gunpowder, stood in fantastic groupes, and a flame glimmered at intervals on the summit of the pile.
For a time hunger and sleep contended, till the constellations reeled before my eyes and then were lost.
I strove to rise, but my heavy lids closed, my limbs over-wearied, claimed repose--I rested my head on the stone, I yielded to the grateful sensation of utter forgetfulness; and in that scene of desolation, on that night of despair--I slept.

CHAPTER III.
THE stars still shone brightly when I awoke, and Taurus high in the southern heaven shewed that it was midnight.
I awoke from disturbed dreams.
Methought I had been invited to Timon's last feast; I came with keen appetite, the covers were removed, the hot water sent up its unsatisfying steams, while I fled before the anger of the host, who assumed the form of Raymond; while to my diseased fancy,
The growing shadow rose and rose, filling, and then seeming to endeavour to burst beyond, the adamantine vault that bent over, sustaining and enclosing the world.
The night-mare became torture; with a strong effort I threw off sleep, and recalled reason to her wonted functions.
My first thought was Perdita; to her I must return; her I must support, drawing such food from despair as might best sustain her wounded heart; recalling her from the wild excesses of grief, by the austere laws of duty, and the soft tenderness of regret.
The position of the stars was my only guide.
I turned from the awful ruin of the Golden City, and, after great exertion, succeeded in extricating myself from its enclosure.
I met a company of soldiers outside the walls; I borrowed a horse from one of them, and hastened to my sister.
The appearance of the plain was changed during this short interval; the encampment was broken up; the relics of the disbanded army met in small companies here and there; each face was clouded; every gesture spoke astonishment and dismay.
With an heavy heart I entered the palace, and stood fearful to advance, to speak, to look.
In the midst of the hall was Perdita; she sat on the marble pavement, her head fallen on her bosom, her hair dishevelled, her fingers twined busily one within the other; she was pale as marble, and every feature was contracted by agony.
She perceived me, and looked up enquiringly; her half glance of hope was misery; the words died before I could articulate them; I felt a ghastly smile wrinkle my lips.
She understood my gesture; again her head fell; again her fingers worked restlessly.
At last I recovered speech, but my voice terrified her; the hapless girl had understood my look, and for worlds she would not that the tale of her heavy misery should have been shaped out and confirmed by hard, irrevocable words.
Nay, she seemed to wish to distract my thoughts from the subject: she rose from the floor: "Hush"!
she said, whisperingly; "after much weeping, Clara sleeps; we must not disturb her".
She seated herself then on the same ottoman where I had left her in the morning resting on the beating heart of her Raymond; I dared not approach her, but sat at a distant corner, watching her starting and nervous gestures.
At length, in an abrupt manner she asked, "Where is he"?
"O, fear not," she continued, "fear not that I should entertain hope!
Yet tell me, have you found him?
To have him once more in my arms, to see him, however changed, is all I desire.
Though Constantinople be heaped above him as a tomb, yet I must find him--then cover us with the city's weight, with a mountain piled above--I care not, so that one grave hold Raymond and his Perdita".
Then weeping, she clung to me: "Take me to him," she cried, "unkind Lionel, why do you keep me here?
Of myself I cannot find him --but you know where he lies--lead me thither".
At first these agonizing plaints filled me with intolerable compassion.
But soon I endeavoured to extract patience for her from the ideas she suggested.
I related my adventures of the night, my endeavours to find our lost one, and my disappointment.
Turning her thoughts this way, I gave them an object which rescued them from insanity.
With apparent calmness she discussed with me the probable spot where he might be found, and planned the means we should use for that purpose.
Then hearing of my fatigue and abstinence, she herself brought me food.
I seized the favourable moment, and endeavoured to awaken in her something beyond the killing torpor of grief.
As I spoke, my subject carried me away; deep admiration; grief, the offspring of truest affection, the overflowing of a heart bursting with sympathy for all that had been great and sublime in the career of my friend, inspired me as I poured forth the
"Alas, for us," I cried, "who have lost this latest honour of the world!
Beloved Raymond!
He is gone to the nations of the dead; he has become one of those, who render the dark abode of the obscure grave illustrious by dwelling there.
He has journied on the road that leads to it, and joined the mighty of soul who went before him.
When the world was in its infancy death must have been terrible, and man left his friends and kindred to dwell, a solitary stranger, in an unknown country.
But now, he who dies finds many companions gone before to prepare for his reception.
The great of past ages people it, the exalted hero of our own days is counted among its inhabitants, while life becomes doubly 'the desart and the solitude.
' "What a noble creature was Raymond, the first among the men of our time.
By the grandeur of his conceptions, the graceful daring of his actions, by his wit and beauty, he won and ruled the minds of all.
Of one only fault he might have been accused; but his death has cancelled that.
I have heard him called inconstant of purpose--when he deserted, for the sake of love, the hope of sovereignty, and when he abdicated the protectorship of England, men blamed his infirmity of purpose.
Now his death has crowned his life, and to the end of time it will be remembered, that he devoted himself, a willing victim, to the glory of Greece.
Such was his choice: he expected to die.
He foresaw that he should leave this cheerful earth, the lightsome sky, and thy love, Perdita; yet he neither hesitated or turned back, going right onward to his mark of fame.
While the earth lasts, his actions will be recorded with praise.
Grecian maidens will in devotion strew flowers on his tomb, and make the air around it resonant with patriotic hymns, in which his name will find high record".
I saw the features of Perdita soften; the sternness of grief yielded to tenderness--I continued:--"Thus to honour him, is the sacred duty of his survivors.
To make his name even as an holy spot of ground, enclosing it from all hostile attacks by our praise, shedding on it the blossoms of love and regret, guarding it from decay, and bequeathing it untainted to posterity.
Such is the duty of his friends.
A dearer one belongs to you, Perdita, mother of his child.
Do you remember in her infancy, with what transport you beheld Clara, recognizing in her the united being of yourself and Raymond; joying to view in this living temple a manifestation of your eternal loves.
Even such is she still.
You say that you have lost Raymond.
O, no!
--yet he lives with you and in you there.
From him she sprung, flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone--and not, as heretofore, are you content to trace in her downy cheek and delicate limbs, an affinity to Raymond, but in her enthusiastic affections, in the sweet qualities of her mind, you may still
Be it your care to foster this similarity--be it your care to render her worthy of him, so that, when she glory in her origin, she take not shame for what she is".
I could perceive that, when I recalled my sister's thoughts to her duties in life, she did not listen with the same patience as before.
She appeared to suspect a plan of consolation on my part, from which she, cherishing her new-born grief, revolted.
"You talk of the future," she said, "while the present is all to me.
Let me find the earthly dwelling of my beloved; let us rescue that from common dust, so that in times to come men may point to the sacred tomb, and name it his--then to other thoughts, and a new course of life, or what else fate, in her cruel tyranny, may
After a short repose I prepared to leave her, that I might endeavour to accomplish her wish.
In the mean time we were joined by Clara, whose pallid cheek and scared look shewed the deep impression grief had made on her young mind.
She seemed to be full of something to which she could not give words; but, seizing an opportunity afforded by Perdita's absence, she preferred to me an earnest prayer, that I would take her within view of the gate at which her father had entered
She promised to commit no extravagance, to be docile, and immediately to return.
I could not refuse; for Clara was not an ordinary child; her sensibility and intelligence seemed already to have endowed her with the rights of womanhood.
With her therefore, before me on my horse, attended only by the servant who was to re-conduct her, we rode to the Top Kapou.
We found a party of soldiers gathered round it.
They were listening.
"They are human cries," said one: "More like the howling of a dog," replied another; and again they bent to catch the sound of regular distant moans, which issued from the precincts of the ruined city.
"That, Clara," I said, "is the gate, that the street which yestermorn your father rode up".
Whatever Clara's intention had been in asking to be brought hither, it was balked by the presence of the soldiers.
With earnest gaze she looked on the labyrinth of smoking piles which had been a city, and then expressed her readiness to return home.
At this moment a melancholy howl struck on our ears; it was repeated; "Hark"!
cried Clara, "he is there; that is Florio, my father's dog".
It seemed to me impossible that she could recognise the sound, but she persisted in her assertion till she gained credit with the crowd about.
At least it would be a benevolent action to rescue the sufferer, whether human or brute, from the desolation of the town; so, sending Clara back to her home, I again entered Constantinople.
Encouraged by the impunity attendant on my former visit, several soldiers who had made a part of Raymond's body guard, who had loved him, and sincerely mourned his loss, accompanied me.
It is impossible to conjecture the strange enchainment of events which restored the lifeless form of my friend to our hands.
In that part of the town where the fire had most raged the night before, and which now lay quenched, black and cold, the dying dog of Raymond crouched beside the mutilated form of its lord.
At such a time sorrow has no voice; affliction, tamed by it is very vehemence, is mute.
The poor animal recognised me, licked my hand, crept close to its lord, and died.
He had been evidently thrown from his horse by some falling ruin, which had crushed his head, and defaced his whole person.
I bent over the body, and took in my hand the edge of his cloak, less altered in appearance than the human frame it clothed.
I pressed it to my lips, while the rough soldiers gathered around, mourning over this worthiest prey of death, as if regret and endless lamentation could re-illumine the extinguished spark, or call to its shattered prison-house of flesh the liberated
Yesterday those limbs were worth an universe; they then enshrined a transcendant power, whose intents, words, and actions were worthy to be recorded in letters of gold; now the superstition of affection alone could give value to the shattered mechanism,
Such as he had now become, such as was his terrene vesture, defaced and spoiled, we wrapt it in our cloaks, and lifting the burthen in our arms, bore it from this city of the dead.
The question arose as to where we should deposit him.
In our road to the palace, we passed through the Greek cemetery; here on a tablet of black marble I caused him to be laid; the cypresses waved high above, their death-like gloom accorded with his state of nothingness.
We cut branches of the funereal trees and placed them over him, and on these again his sword.
I left a guard to protect this treasure of dust; and ordered perpetual torches to be burned around.
When I returned to Perdita, I found that she had already been informed of the success of my undertaking.
He, her beloved, the sole and eternal object of her passionate tenderness, was restored her.
Such was the maniac language of her enthusiasm.
What though those limbs moved not, and those lips could no more frame modulated accents of wisdom and love!
What though like a weed flung from the fruitless sea, he lay the prey of corruption-- still that was the form she had caressed, those the lips that meeting hers, had drank the spirit of love from the commingling breath; that was the earthly mechanism of
True, she looked forward to another life; true, the burning spirit of love seemed to her unextinguishable throughout eternity.
Yet at this time, with human fondness, she clung to all that her human senses permitted her to see and feel to be a part of Raymond.
Pale as marble, clear and beaming as that, she heard my tale, and enquired concerning the spot where he had been deposited.
Her features had lost the distortion of grief; her eyes were brightened, her very person seemed dilated; while the excessive whiteness and even transparency of her skin, and something hollow in her voice, bore witness that not tranquillity, but excess of
I asked her where he should be buried.
She replied, "At Athens; even at the Athens which he loved.
Without the town, on the acclivity of Hymettus, there is a rocky recess which he pointed out to me as the spot where he would wish to repose".
My own desire certainly was that he should not be removed from the spot where he now lay.
But her wish was of course to be complied with; and I entreated her to prepare without delay for our departure.
Behold now the melancholy train cross the flats of Thrace, and wind through the defiles, and over the mountains of Macedonia, coast the clear waves of the Peneus, cross the Larissean plain, pass the straits of Thermopylae, and ascending in succession Oeta
Women bear with resignation these long drawn ills, but to a man's impatient spirit, the slow motion of our cavalcade, the melancholy repose we took at noon, the perpetual presence of the pall, gorgeous though it was, that wrapt the rifled casket which had
Perdita, shut up in herself, spoke little.
Her carriage was closed; and, when we rested, she sat leaning her pale cheek on her white cold hand, with eyes fixed on the ground, indulging thoughts which refused communication or sympathy.
We descended from Parnassus, emerging from its many folds, and passed through Livadia on our road to Attica.
Perdita would not enter Athens; but reposing at Marathon on the night of our arrival, conducted me on the following day, to the spot selected by her as the treasure house of Raymond's dear remains.
It was in a recess near the head of the ravine to the south of Hymettus.
The chasm, deep, black, and hoary, swept from the summit to the base; in the fissures of the rock myrtle underwood grew and wild thyme, the food of many nations of bees; enormous crags protruded into the cleft, some beetling over, others rising
At the foot of this sublime chasm, a fertile laughing valley reached from sea to sea, and beyond was spread the blue Aegean, sprinkled with islands, the light waves glancing beneath the sun.
Close to the spot on which we stood, was a solitary rock, high and conical, which, divided on every side from the mountain, seemed a nature-hewn pyramid; with little labour this block was reduced to a perfect shape; the narrow cell was scooped out beneath
Every thing was accomplished with speed under my directions.
I agreed to leave the finishing and guardianship of the tomb to the head of the religious establishment at Athens, and by the end of October prepared for my return to England.
I mentioned this to Perdita.
It was painful to appear to drag her from the last scene that spoke of her lost one; but to linger here was vain, and my very soul was sick with its yearning to rejoin my Idris and her babes.
In reply, my sister requested me to accompany her the following evening to the tomb of Raymond.
Some days had passed since I had visited the spot.
The path to it had been enlarged, and steps hewn in the rock led us less circuitously than before, to the spot itself; the platform on which the pyramid stood was enlarged, and looking towards the south, in a recess overshadowed by the straggling branches
"Did I not do right," said Perdita, "in having my loved one conveyed hither?
Hereafter this will be the cynosure of Greece.
In such a spot death loses half its terrors, and even the inanimate dust appears to partake of the spirit of beauty which hallows this region.
Lionel, he sleeps there; that is the grave of Raymond, he whom in my youth I first loved; whom my heart accompanied in days of separation and anger; to whom I am now joined for ever.
Never--mark me--never will I leave this spot.
Methinks his spirit remains here as well as that dust, which, uncommunicable though it be, is more precious in its nothingness than aught else widowed earth clasps to her sorrowing bosom.
The myrtle bushes, the thyme, the little cyclamen, which peep from the fissures of the rock, all the produce of the place, bear affinity to him; the light that invests the hills participates in his essence, and sky and mountains, sea and valley, are imbued
I will live and die here!
"Go you to England, Lionel; return to sweet Idris and dearest Adrian; return, and let my orphan girl be as a child of your own in your house.
Look on me as dead; and truly if death be a mere change of state, I am dead.
This is another world, from that which late I inhabited, from that which is now your home.
Here I hold communion only with the has been, and to come.
Go you to England, and leave me where alone I can consent to drag out the miserable days which I must still live".
A shower of tears terminated her sad harangue.
I had expected some extravagant proposition, and remained silent awhile, collecting my thoughts that I might the better combat her fanciful scheme.
"You cherish dreary thoughts, my dear Perdita," I said, "nor do I wonder that for a time your better reason should be influenced by passionate grief and a disturbed imagination.
Even I am in love with this last home of Raymond's; nevertheless we must quit it".
"I expected this," cried Perdita; "I supposed that you would treat me as a mad, foolish girl.
But do not deceive yourself; this cottage is built by my order; and here I shall remain, until the hour arrives when I may share his happier dwelling".
"My dearest girl"!
"And what is there so strange in my design?
I might have deceived you; I might have talked of remaining here only a few months; in your anxiety to reach Windsor you would have left me, and without reproach or contention, I might have pursued my plan.
But I disdained the artifice; or rather in my wretchedness it was my only consolation to pour out my heart to you, my brother, my only friend.
You will not dispute with me?
You know how wilful your poor, misery-stricken sister is.
Take my girl with you; wean her from sights and thoughts of sorrow; let infantine hilarity revisit her heart, and animate her eyes; so could it never be, were she near me; it is far better for all of you that you should never see me again.
For myself, I will not voluntarily seek death, that is, I will not, while I can command myself; and I can here.
But drag me from this country; and my power of self control vanishes, nor can I answer for the violence my agony of grief may lead me to commit".
"You clothe your meaning, Perdita," I replied, "in powerful words, yet that meaning is selfish and unworthy of you.
You have often agreed with me that there is but one solution to the intricate riddle of life; to improve ourselves, and contribute to the happiness of others: and now, in the very prime of life, you desert your principles, and shut yourself up in useless
Will you think of Raymond less at Windsor, the scene of your early happiness?
Will you commune less with his departed spirit, while you watch over and cultivate the rare excellence of his child?
You have been sadly visited; nor do I wonder that a feeling akin to insanity should drive you to bitter and unreasonable imaginings.
But a home of love awaits you in your native England.
My tenderness and affection must soothe you; the society of Raymond's friends will be of more solace than these dreary speculations.
We will all make it our first care, our dearest task, to contribute to your happiness".
Perdita shook her head; "If it could be so," she replied, "I were much in the wrong to disdain your offers.
But it is not a matter of choice; I can live here only.
I am a part of this scene; each and all its properties are a part of me.
This is no sudden fancy; I live by it.
The knowledge that I am here, rises with me in the morning, and enables me to endure the light; it is mingled with my food, which else were poison; it walks, it sleeps with me, for ever it accompanies me.
Here I may even cease to repine, and may add my tardy consent to the decree which has taken him from me.
He would rather have died such a death, which will be recorded in history to endless time, than have lived to old age unknown, unhonoured.
Nor can I desire better, than, having been the chosen and beloved of his heart, here, in youth's prime, before added years can tarnish the best feelings of my nature, to watch his tomb, and speedily rejoin him in his blessed repose.
"So much, my dearest Lionel, I have said, wishing to persuade you that I do right.
If you are unconvinced, I can add nothing further by way of argument, and I can only declare my fixed resolve.
I stay here; force only can remove me.
Be it so; drag me away--I return; confine me, imprison me, still I escape, and come here.
Or would my brother rather devote the heart-broken Perdita to the straw and chains of a maniac, than suffer her to rest in peace beneath the shadow of His society, in this my own selected and beloved recess"?
-- All this appeared to me, I own, methodized madness.
I imagined, that it was my imperative duty to take her from scenes that thus forcibly reminded her of her loss.
Nor did I doubt, that in the tranquillity of our family circle at Windsor, she would recover some degree of composure, and in the end, of happiness.
My affection for Clara also led me to oppose these fond dreams of cherished grief; her sensibility had already been too much excited; her infant heedlessness too soon exchanged for deep and anxious thought.
The strange and romantic scheme of her mother, might confirm and perpetuate the painful view of life, which had intruded itself thus early on her contemplation.
On returning home, the captain of the steam packet with whom I had agreed to sail, came to tell me, that accidental circumstances hastened his departure, and that, if I went with him, I must come on board at five on the following morning.
I hastily gave my consent to this arrangement, and as hastily formed a plan through which Perdita should be forced to become my companion.
I believe that most people in my situation would have acted in the same manner.
Yet this consideration does not, or rather did not in after time, diminish the reproaches of my conscience.
At the moment, I felt convinced that I was acting for the best, and that all I did was right and even necessary.
I sat with Perdita and soothed her, by my seeming assent to her wild scheme.
She received my concurrence with pleasure, and a thousand times over thanked her deceiving, deceitful brother.
As night came on, her spirits, enlivened by my unexpected concession, regained an almost forgotten vivacity.
I pretended to be alarmed by the feverish glow in her cheek; I entreated her to take a composing draught; I poured out the medicine, which she took docilely from me.
I watched her as she drank it.
Falsehood and artifice are in themselves so hateful, that, though I still thought I did right, a feeling of shame and guilt came painfully upon me.
I left her, and soon heard that she slept soundly under the influence of the opiate I had administered.
She was carried thus unconscious on board; the anchor weighed, and the wind being favourable, we stood far out to sea; with all the canvas spread, and the power of the engine to assist, we scudded swiftly and steadily through the chafed element.
It was late in the day before Perdita awoke, and a longer time elapsed before recovering from the torpor occasioned by the laudanum, she perceived her change of situation.
She started wildly from her couch, and flew to the cabin window.
The blue and troubled sea sped past the vessel, and was spread shoreless around: the sky was covered by a rack, which in its swift motion shewed how speedily she was borne away.
The creaking of the masts, the clang of the wheels, the tramp above, all persuaded her that she was already far from the shores of Greece.
--"Where are we"?
she cried, "where are we going"?
-- The attendant whom I had stationed to watch her, replied, "to England".
-- "And my brother"?
-- "Is on deck, Madam".
"Unkind!
unkind"!
exclaimed the poor victim, as with a deep sigh she looked on the waste of waters.
Then without further remark, she threw herself on her couch, and closing her eyes remained motionless; so that but for the deep sighs that burst from her, it would have seemed that she slept.
As soon as I heard that she had spoken, I sent Clara to her, that the sight of the lovely innocent might inspire gentle and affectionate thoughts.
But neither the presence of her child, nor a subsequent visit from me, could rouse my sister.
She looked on Clara with a countenance of woful meaning, but she did not speak.
When I appeared, she turned away, and in reply to my enquiries, only said, "You know not what you have done"!
--I trusted that this sullenness betokened merely the struggle between disappointment and natural affection, and that in a few days she would be reconciled to her fate.
When night came on, she begged that Clara might sleep in a separate cabin.
Her servant, however, remained with her.
About midnight she spoke to the latter, saying that she had had a bad dream, and bade her go to her daughter, and bring word whether she rested quietly.
The woman obeyed.
The breeze, that had flagged since sunset, now rose again.
I was on deck, enjoying our swift progress.
The quiet was disturbed only by the rush of waters as they divided before the steady keel, the murmur of the moveless and full sails, the wind whistling in the shrouds, and the regular motion of the engine.
The sea was gently agitated, now shewing a white crest, and now resuming an uniform hue; the clouds had disappeared; and dark ether clipt the broad ocean, in which the constellations vainly sought their accustomed mirror.
Our rate could not have been less than eight knots.
Suddenly I heard a splash in the sea.
The sailors on watch rushed to the side of the vessel, with the cry--some one gone overboard.
"It is not from deck," said the man at the helm, "something has been thrown from the aft cabin".
A call for the boat to be lowered was echoed from the deck.
I rushed into my sister's cabin; it was empty.
With sails abaft, the engine stopt, the vessel remained unwillingly stationary, until, after an hour's search, my poor Perdita was brought on board.
But no care could re-animate her, no medicine cause her dear eyes to open, and the blood to flow again from her pulseless heart.
One clenched hand contained a slip of paper, on which was written, "To Athens".
To ensure her removal thither, and prevent the irrecoverable loss of her body in the wide sea, she had had the precaution to fasten a long shawl round her waist, and again to the staunchions of the cabin window.
She had drifted somewhat under the keel of the vessel, and her being out of sight occasioned the delay in finding her.
And thus the ill-starred girl died a victim to my senseless rashness.
Thus, in early day, she left us for the company of the dead, and preferred to share the rocky grave of Raymond, before the animated scene this cheerful earth afforded, and the society of loving friends.
Thus in her twenty-ninth year she died; having enjoyed some few years of the happiness of paradise, and sustaining a reverse to which her impatient spirit and affectionate disposition were unable to submit.
As I marked the placid expression that had settled on her countenance in death, I felt, in spite of the pangs of remorse, in spite of heart-rending regret, that it was better to die so, than to drag on long, miserable years of repining and inconsolable
Stress of weather drove us up the Adriatic Gulph; and, our vessel being hardly fitted to weather a storm, we took refuge in the port of Ancona.
Here I met Georgio Palli, the vice-admiral of the Greek fleet, a former friend and warm partizan of Raymond.
I committed the remains of my lost Perdita to his care, for the purpose of having them transported to Hymettus, and placed in the cell her Raymond already occupied beneath the pyramid.
This was all accomplished even as I wished.
She reposed beside her beloved, and the tomb above was inscribed with the united names of Raymond and Perdita.
I then came to a resolution of pursuing our journey to England overland.
My own heart was racked by regrets and remorse.
The apprehension, that Raymond had departed for ever, that his name, blended eternally with the past, must be erased from every anticipation of the future, had come slowly upon me.
I had always admired his talents; his noble aspirations; his grand conceptions of the glory and majesty of his ambition: his utter want of mean passions; his fortitude and daring.
In Greece I had learnt to love him; his very waywardness, and self-abandonment to the impulses of superstition, attached me to him doubly; it might be weakness, but it was the antipodes of all that was grovelling and selfish.
To these pangs were added the loss of Perdita, lost through my own accursed self-will and conceit.
This dear one, my sole relation; whose progress I had marked from tender childhood through the varied path of life, and seen her throughout conspicuous for integrity, devotion, and true affection; for all that constitutes the peculiar graces of the female
I concealed from this beloved child that her mother's death was voluntary, and tried every means to awaken cheerfulness in her sorrow-stricken spirit.
One of my first acts for the recovery even of my own composure, was to bid farewell to the sea.
Its hateful splash renewed again and again to my sense the death of my sister; its roar was a dirge; in every dark hull that was tossed on its inconstant bosom, I imaged a bier, that would convey to death all who trusted to its treacherous smiles.
Farewell to the sea!
Come, my Clara, sit beside me in this aerial bark; quickly and gently it cleaves the azure serene, and with soft undulation glides upon the current of the air; or, if storm shake its fragile mechanism, the green earth is below; we can descend, and take
Here aloft, the companions of the swift-winged birds, we skim through the unresisting element, fleetly and fearlessly.
The light boat heaves not, nor is opposed by death-bearing waves; the ether opens before the prow, and the shadow of the globe that upholds it, shelters us from the noon-day sun.
Beneath are the plains of Italy, or the vast undulations of the wave-like Apennines: fertility reposes in their many folds, and woods crown the summits.
The free and happy peasant, unshackled by the Austrian, bears the double harvest to the garner; and the refined citizens rear without dread the long blighted tree of knowledge in this garden of the world.
We were lifted above the Alpine peaks, and from their deep and brawling ravines entered the plain of fair France, and after an airy journey of six days, we landed at Dieppe, furled the feathered wings, and closed the silken globe of our little pinnace.
A heavy rain made this mode of travelling now incommodious; so we embarked in a steam-packet, and after a short passage landed at Portsmouth.
A strange story was rife here.
A few days before, a tempest-struck vessel had appeared off the town: the hull was parched-looking and cracked, the sails rent, and bent in a careless, unseamanlike manner, the shrouds tangled and broken.
She drifted towards the harbour, and was stranded on the sands at the entrance.
In the morning the custom-house officers, together with a crowd of idlers, visited her.
One only of the crew appeared to have arrived with her.
He had got to shore, and had walked a few paces towards the town, and then, vanquished by malady and approaching death, had fallen on the inhospitable beach.
He was found stiff, his hands clenched, and pressed against his breast.
His skin, nearly black, his matted hair and bristly beard, were signs of a long protracted misery.
It was whispered that he had died of the plague.
No one ventured on board the vessel, and strange sights were averred to be seen at night, walking the deck, and hanging on the masts and shrouds.
She soon went to pieces; I was shewn where she had been, and saw her disjoined timbers tossed on the waves.
The body of the man who had landed, had been buried deep in the sands; and none could tell more, than that the vessel was American built, and that several months before the Fortunatas had sailed from Philadelphia, of which no tidings were afterwards
CHAPTER IV.
I RETURNED to my family estate in the autumn of the year 2092.
My heart had long been with them; and I felt sick with the hope and delight of seeing them again.
The district which contained them appeared the abode of every kindly spirit.
Happiness, love and peace, walked the forest paths, and tempered the atmosphere.
After all the agitation and sorrow I had endured in Greece, I sought Windsor, as the storm-driven bird does the nest in which it may fold its wings in tranquillity.
How unwise had the wanderers been, who had deserted its shelter, entangled themselves in the web of society, and entered on what men of the world call "life,"--that labyrinth of evil, that scheme of mutual torture.
To live, according to this sense of the word, we must not only observe and learn, we must also feel; we must not be mere spectators of action, we must act; we must not describe, but be subjects of description.
Deep sorrow must have been the inmate of our bosoms; fraud must have lain in wait for us; the artful must have deceived us; sickening doubt and false hope must have chequered our days; hilarity and joy, that lap the soul in ecstasy, must at times have
Who that knows what "life" is, would pine for this feverish species of existence?
I have lived.
I have spent days and nights of festivity; I have joined in ambitious hopes, and exulted in victory: now,--shut the door on the world, and build high the wall that is to separate me from the troubled scene enacted within its precincts.
Let us live for each other and for happiness; let us seek peace in our dear home, near the inland murmur of streams, and the gracious waving of trees, the beauteous vesture of earth, and sublime pageantry of the skies.
Let us leave "life," that we may live.
Idris was well content with this resolve of mine.
Her native sprightliness needed no undue excitement, and her placid heart reposed contented on my love, the well-being of her children, and the beauty of surrounding nature.
Her pride and blameless ambition was to create smiles in all around her, and to shed repose on the fragile existence of her brother.
In spite of her tender nursing, the health of Adrian perceptibly declined.
Walking, riding, the common occupations of life, overcame him: he felt no pain, but seemed to tremble for ever on the verge of annihilation.
Yet, as he had lived on for months nearly in the same state, he did not inspire us with any immediate fear; and, though he talked of death as an event most familiar to his thoughts, he did not cease to exert himself to render others happy, or to cultivate
Winter passed away; and spring, led by the months, awakened life in all nature.
The forest was dressed in green; the young calves frisked on the new-sprung grass; the wind-winged shadows of light clouds sped over the green cornfields; the hermit cuckoo repeated his monotonous all-hail to the season; the nightingale, bird of love and
Delight awoke in every heart, delight and exultation; for there was peace through all the world; the temple of Universal Janus was shut, and man died not that year by the hand of man.
"Let this last but twelve months," said Adrian; "and earth will become a Paradise.
The energies of man were before directed to the destruction of his species: they now aim at its liberation and preservation.
Man cannot repose, and his restless aspirations will now bring forth good instead of evil.
The favoured countries of the south will throw off the iron yoke of servitude; poverty will quit us, and with that, sickness.
What may not the forces, never before united, of liberty and peace achieve in this dwelling of man"?
"Dreaming, for ever dreaming, Windsor"!
said Ryland, the old adversary of Raymond, and candidate for the Protectorate at the ensuing election.
"Be assured that earth is not, nor ever can be heaven, while the seeds of hell are natives of her soil.
When the seasons have become equal, when the air breeds no disorders, when its surface is no longer liable to blights and droughts, then sickness will cease; when men's passions are dead, poverty will depart.
When love is no longer akin to hate, then brotherhood will exist: we are very far from that state at present".
"Not so far as you may suppose," observed a little old astronomer, by name Merrival, "the poles precede slowly, but securely; in an hundred thousand years--" "We shall all be underground," said Ryland.
"The pole of the earth will coincide with the pole of the ecliptic," continued the astronomer, "an universal spring will be produced, and earth become a paradise".
"And we shall of course enjoy the benefit of the change," said Ryland, contemptuously.
"We have strange news here," I observed.
I had the newspaper in my hand, and, as usual, had turned to the intelligence from Greece.
"It seems that the total destruction of Constantinople, and the supposition that winter had purified the air of the fallen city, gave the Greeks courage to visit its site, and begin to rebuild it.
But they tell us that the curse of God is on the place, for every one who has ventured within the walls has been tainted by the plague; that this disease has spread in Thrace and Macedonia; and now, fearing the virulence of infection during the coming
This intelligence brought us back from the prospect of paradise, held out after the lapse of an hundred thousand years, to the pain and misery at present existent upon earth.
We talked of the ravages made last year by pestilence in every quarter of the world; and of the dreadful consequences of a second visitation.
We discussed the best means of preventing infection, and of preserving health and activity in a large city thus afflicted--London, for instance.
Merrival did not join in this conversation; drawing near Idris, he proceeded to assure her that the joyful prospect of an earthly paradise after an hundred thousand years, was clouded to him by the knowledge that in a certain period of time after, an
[1] Our party at length broke up; "We are all dreaming this morning," said Ryland, "it is as wise to discuss the probability of a visitation of the plague in our well-governed metropolis, as to calculate the centuries which must escape before we can grow
But, though it seemed absurd to calculate upon the arrival of the plague in London, I could not reflect without extreme pain on the desolation this evil would cause in Greece.
The English for the most part talked of Thrace and Macedonia, as they would of a lunar territory, which, unknown to them, presented no distinct idea or interest to the minds.
I had trod the soil.
The faces of many of the inhabitants were familiar to me; in the towns, plains, hills, and defiles of these countries, I had enjoyed unspeakable delight, as I journied through them the year before.
Some romantic village, some cottage, or elegant abode there situated, inhabited by the lovely and the good, rose before my mental sight, and the question haunted me, is the plague there also?
--That same invincible monster, which hovered over and devoured Constantinople--that fiend more cruel than tempest, less tame than fire, is, alas, unchained in that beautiful country--these reflections would not allow me to rest.
The political state of England became agitated as the time drew near when the new Protector was to be elected.
This event excited the more interest, since it was the current report, that if the popular candidate (Ryland) should be chosen, the question of the abolition of hereditary rank, and other feudal relics, would come under the consideration of parliament.
Not a word had been spoken during the present session on any of these topics.
Every thing would depend upon the choice of a Protector, and the elections of the ensuing year.
Yet this very silence was awful, shewing the deep weight attributed to the question; the fear of either party to hazard an ill-timed attack, and the expectation of a furious contention when it should begin.
But although St. Stephen's did not echo with the voice which filled each heart, the newspapers teemed with nothing else; and in private companies the conversation however remotely begun, soon verged towards this central point, while voices were lowered and
The nobles did not hesitate to express their fear; the other party endeavoured to treat the matter lightly.
"Shame on the country," said Ryland, "to lay so much stress upon words and frippery; it is a question of nothing; of the new painting of carriage-pannels and the embroidery of footmen's coats".
Yet could England indeed doff her lordly trappings, and be content with the democratic style of America?
Were the pride of ancestry, the patrician spirit, the gentle courtesies and refined pursuits, splendid attributes of rank, to be erased among us?
We were told that this would not be the case; that we were by nature a poetical people, a nation easily duped by words, ready to array clouds in splendour, and bestow honour on the dust.
This spirit we could never lose; and it was to diffuse this concentrated spirit of birth, that the new law was to be brought forward.
We were assured that, when the name and title of Englishman was the sole patent of nobility, we should all be noble; that when no man born under English sway, felt another his superior in rank, courtesy and refinement would become the birth-right of all
Let not England be so far disgraced, as to have it imagined that it can be without nobles, nature's true nobility, who bear their patent in their mien, who are from their cradle elevated above the rest of their species, because they are better than the
Among a race of independent, and generous, and well educated men, in a country where the imagination is empress of men's minds, there needs be no fear that we should want a perpetual succession of the high-born and lordly.
That party, however, could hardly yet be considered a minority in the kingdom, who extolled the ornament of the column, "the Corinthian capital of polished society;" they appealed to prejudices without number, to old attachments and young hopes; to the
The plague had come to Athens.
Hundreds of English residents returned to their own country.
Raymond's beloved Athenians, the free, the noble people of the divinest town in Greece, fell like ripe corn before the merciless sickle of the adversary.
Its pleasant places were deserted; its temples and palaces were converted into tombs; its energies, bent before towards the highest objects of human ambition, were now forced to converge to one point, the guarding against the innumerous arrows of the
At any other time this disaster would have excited extreme compassion among us; but it was now passed over, while each mind was engaged by the coming controversy.
It was not so with me; and the question of rank and right dwindled to insignificance in my eyes, when I pictured the scene of suffering Athens.
I heard of the death of only sons; of wives and husbands most devoted; of the rending of ties twisted with the heart's fibres, of friend losing friend, and young mothers mourning for their first born; and these moving incidents were grouped and painted in
It was the admirers, friends, fellow soldiers of Raymond, families that had welcomed Perdita to Greece, and lamented with her the loss of her lord, that were swept away, and went to dwell with them in the undistinguishing tomb.
The plague at Athens had been preceded and caused by the contagion from the East; and the scene of havoc and death continued to be acted there, on a scale of fearful magnitude.
A hope that the visitation of the present year would prove the last, kept up the spirits of the merchants connected with these countries; but the inhabitants were driven to despair, or to a resignation which, arising from fanaticism, assumed the same dark
America had also received the taint; and, were it yellow fever or plague, the epidemic was gifted with a virulence before unfelt.
The devastation was not confined to the towns, but spread throughout the country; the hunter died in the woods, the peasant in the corn-fields, and the fisher on his native waters.
A strange story was brought to us from the East, to which little credit would have been given, had not the fact been attested by a multitude of witnesses, in various parts of the world.
On the twenty-first of June, it was said that an hour before noon, a black sun arose: an orb, the size of that luminary, but dark, defined, whose beams were shadows, ascended from the west; in about an hour it had reached the meridian, and eclipsed the
Night fell upon every country, night, sudden, rayless, entire.
The stars came out, shedding their ineffectual glimmerings on the light-widowed earth.
But soon the dim orb passed from over the sun, and lingered down the eastern heaven.
As it descended, its dusky rays crossed the brilliant ones of the sun, and deadened or distorted them.
The shadows of things assumed strange and ghastly shapes.
The wild animals in the woods took fright at the unknown shapes figured on the ground.
They fled they knew not whither; and the citizens were filled with greater dread, at the convulsion which "shook lions into civil streets;"--birds, strong-winged eagles, suddenly blinded, fell in the market-places, while owls and bats shewed themselves
Gradually the object of fear sank beneath the horizon, and to the last shot up shadowy beams into the otherwise radiant air.
Such was the tale sent us from Asia, from the eastern extremity of Europe, and from Africa as far west as the Golden Coast.
Whether this story were true or not, the effects were certain.
Through Asia, from the banks of the Nile to the shores of the Caspian, from the Hellespont even to the sea of Oman, a sudden panic was driven.
The men filled the mosques; the women, veiled, hastened to the tombs, and carried offerings to the dead, thus to preserve the living.
The plague was forgotten, in this new fear which the black sun had spread; and, though the dead multiplied, and the streets of Ispahan, of Pekin, and of Delhi were strewed with pestilence-struck corpses, men passed on, gazing on the ominous sky, regardless
The christians sought their churches,--christian maidens, even at the feast of roses, clad in white, with shining veils, sought, in long procession, the places consecrated to their religion, filling the air with their hymns; while, ever and anon, from the
In the sunny clime of Persia, in the crowded cities of China, amidst the aromatic groves of Cashmere, and along the southern shores of the Mediterranean, such scenes had place.
Even in Greece the tale of the sun of darkness encreased the fears and despair of the dying multitude.
We, in our cloudy isle, were far removed from danger, and the only circumstance that brought these disasters at all home to us, was the daily arrival of vessels from the east, crowded with emigrants, mostly English; for the Moslems, though the fear of
Mecca had never before been so crowded with pilgrims; yet the Arabs neglected to pillage the caravans, but, humble and weaponless, they joined the procession, praying Mahomet to avert plague from their tents and deserts.
I cannot describe the rapturous delight with which I turned from political brawls at home, and the physical evils of distant countries, to my own dear home, to the selected abode of goodness and love; to peace, and the interchange of every sacred sympathy.
Had I never quitted Windsor, these emotions would not have been so intense; but I had in Greece been the prey of fear and deplorable change; in Greece, after a period of anxiety and sorrow, I had seen depart two, whose very names were the symbol of
But such miseries could never intrude upon the domestic circle left to me, while, secluded in our beloved forest, we passed our lives in tranquillity.
Some small change indeed the progress of years brought here; and time, as it is wont, stamped the traces of mortality on our pleasures and expectations.
Idris, the most affectionate wife, sister and friend, was a tender and loving mother.
The feeling was not with her as with many, a pastime; it was a passion.
We had had three children; one, the second in age, died while I was in Greece.
This had dashed the triumphant and rapturous emotions of maternity with grief and fear.
Before this event, the little beings, sprung from herself, the young heirs of her transient life, seemed to have a sure lease of existence; now she dreaded that the pitiless destroyer might snatch her remaining darlings, as it had snatched their brother.
The least illness caused throes of terror; she was miserable if she were at all absent from them; her treasure of happiness she had garnered in their fragile being, and kept forever on the watch, lest the insidious thief should as before steal these valued
She had fortunately small cause for fear.
Alfred, now nine years old, was an upright, manly little fellow, with radiant brow, soft eyes, and gentle, though independent disposition.
Our youngest was yet in infancy; but his downy cheek was sprinkled with the roses of health, and his unwearied vivacity filled our halls with innocent laughter.
Clara had passed the age which, from its mute ignorance, was the source of the fears of Idris.
Clara was dear to her, to all.
There was so much intelligence combined with innocence, sensibility with forbearance, and seriousness with perfect good-humour, a beauty so transcendant, united to such endearing simplicity, that she hung like a pearl in the shrine of our possessions, a
At the beginning of winter our Alfred, now nine years of age, first went to school at Eton.
This appeared to him the primary step towards manhood, and he was proportionably pleased.
Community of study and amusement developed the best parts of his character, his steady perseverance, generosity, and well-governed firmness.
What deep and sacred emotions are excited in a father's bosom, when he first becomes convinced that his love for his child is not a mere instinct, but worthily bestowed, and that others, less akin, participate his approbation!
It was supreme happiness to Idris and myself, to find that the frankness which Alfred's open brow indicated, the intelligence of his eyes, the tempered sensibility of his tones, were not delusions, but indications of talents and virtues, which would "grow
At this period, the termination of an animal's love for its offspring,--the true affection of the human parent commences.
We no longer look on this dearest part of ourselves, as a tender plant which we must cherish, or a plaything for an idle hour.
We build now on his intellectual faculties, we establish our hopes on his moral propensities.
His weakness still imparts anxiety to this feeling, his ignorance prevents entire intimacy; but we begin to respect the future man, and to endeavour to secure his esteem, even as if he were our equal.
What can a parent have more at heart than the good opinion of his child?
In all our transactions with him our honour must be inviolate, the integrity of our relations untainted: fate and circumstance may, when he arrives at maturity, separate us for ever--but, as his aegis in danger, his consolation in hardship, let the ardent
We had lived so long in the vicinity of Eton, that its population of young folks was well known to us.
Many of them had been Alfred's playmates, before they became his school-fellows.
We now watched this youthful congregation with redoubled interest.
We marked the difference of character among the boys, and endeavoured to read the future man in the stripling.
There is nothing more lovely, to which the heart more yearns than a free-spirited boy, gentle, brave, and generous.
Several of the Etonians had these characteristics; all were distinguished by a sense of honour, and spirit of enterprize; in some, as they verged towards manhood, this degenerated into presumption; but the younger ones, lads a little older than our own,
Here were the future governors of England; the men, who, when our ardour was cold, and our projects completed or destroyed for ever, when, our drama acted, we doffed the garb of the hour, and assumed the uniform of age, or of more equalizing death; here
It was not long since I was like one of these beardless aspirants; when my boy shall have obtained the place I now hold, I shall have tottered into a grey-headed, wrinkled old man.
Strange system!

Such is, to borrow the words of an eloquent and philosophic writer, "the mode of existence decreed to a permanent body composed of transitory parts; wherein, by the disposition of a stupendous wisdom, moulding together the great mysterious incorporation of

I will make way for thee.
I have already put off the carelessness of childhood, the unlined brow, and springy gait of early years, that they may adorn thee.
Advance; and I will despoil myself still further for thy advantage.
Time shall rob me of the graces of maturity, shall take the fire from my eyes, and agility from my limbs, shall steal the better part of life, eager expectation and passionate love, and shower them in double portion on thy dear head.
Advance!

May your progress be uninterrupted and secure; born during the spring-tide of the hopes of man, may you lead up the summer to which no winter may succeed!

CHAPTER V. SOME disorder had surely crept into the course of the elements, destroying their benignant influence.
The wind, prince of air, raged through his kingdom, lashing the sea into fury, and subduing the rebel earth into some sort of obedience.
The God sends down his angry plagues from high, Famine and pestilence in heaps they die.
Again in vengeance of his wrath he falls On their great hosts, and breaks their tottering walls; Arrests their navies on the ocean's plain, And whelms their strength with mountains of the main.
Their deadly power shook the flourishing countries of the south, and during winter, even, we, in our northern retreat, began to quake under their ill effects.
That fable is unjust, which gives the superiority to the sun over the wind.
Who has not seen the lightsome earth, the balmy atmosphere, and basking nature become dark, cold and ungenial, when the sleeping wind has awoke in the east?
Or, when the dun clouds thickly veil the sky, while exhaustless stores of rain are poured down, until, the dank earth refusing to imbibe the superabundant moisture, it lies in pools on the surface; when the torch of day seems like a meteor, to be quenched;
The clouds become thin; an arch is formed for ever rising upwards, till, the universal cope being unveiled, the sun pours forth its rays, re-animated and fed by the breeze.
Then mighty art thou, O wind, to be throned above all other vicegerents of nature's power; whether thou comest destroying from the east, or pregnant with elementary life from the west; thee the clouds obey; the sun is subservient to thee; the shoreless
Thou sweepest over the earth, and oaks, the growth of centuries, submit to thy viewless axe; the snow-drift is scattered on the pinnacles of the Alps, the avalanche thunders down their vallies.
Thou holdest the keys of the frost, and canst first chain and then set free the streams; under thy gentle governance the buds and leaves are born, they flourish nursed by thee.
Why dost thou howl thus, O wind?
By day and by night for four long months thy roarings have not ceased--the shores of the sea are strewn with wrecks, its keel-welcoming surface has become impassable, the earth has shed her beauty in obedience to thy command; the frail balloon dares no
Alas, what will become of us?
It seems as if the giant waves of ocean, and vast arms of the sea, were about to wrench the deep-rooted island from its centre; and cast it, a ruin and a wreck, upon the fields of the Atlantic.
What are we, the inhabitants of this globe, least among the many that people infinite space?
Our minds embrace infinity; the visible mechanism of our being is subject to merest accident.
Day by day we are forced to believe this.
He whom a scratch has disorganized, he who disappears from apparent life under the influence of the hostile agency at work around us, had the same powers as I--I also am subject to the same laws.
In the face of all this we call ourselves lords of the creation, wielders of the elements, masters of life and death, and we allege in excuse of this arrogance, that though the individual is destroyed, man continues for ever.
Thus, losing our identity, that of which we are chiefly conscious, we glory in the continuity of our species, and learn to regard death without terror.
But when any whole nation becomes the victim of the destructive powers of exterior agents, then indeed man shrinks into insignificance, he feels his tenure of life insecure, his inheritance on earth cut off.
I remember, after having witnessed the destructive effects of a fire, I could not even behold a small one in a stove, without a sensation of fear.
The mounting flames had curled round the building, as it fell, and was destroyed.
They insinuated themselves into the substances about them, and the impediments to their progress yielded at their touch.
Could we take integral parts of this power, and not be subject to its operation?
Could we domesticate a cub of this wild beast, and not fear its growth and maturity?
Thus we began to feel, with regard to many-visaged death let loose on the chosen districts of our fair habitation, and above all, with regard to the plague.
We feared the coming summer.
Nations, bordering on the already infected countries, began to enter upon serious plans for the better keeping out of the enemy.
We, a commercial people, were obliged to bring such schemes under consideration; and the question of contagion became matter of earnest disquisition.
That the plague was not what is commonly called contagious, like the scarlet fever, or extinct small-pox, was proved.
It was called an epidemic.
But the grand question was still unsettled of how this epidemic was generated and increased.
If infection depended upon the air, the air was subject to infection.
As for instance, a typhus fever has been brought by ships to one sea-port town; yet the very people who brought it there, were incapable of communicating it in a town more fortunately situated.
But how are we to judge of airs, and pronounce--in such a city plague will die unproductive; in such another, nature has provided for it a plentiful harvest?
In the same way, individuals may escape ninety-nine times, and receive the death-blow at the hundredth; because bodies are sometimes in a state to reject the infection of malady, and at others, thirsty to imbibe it.
These reflections made our legislators pause, before they could decide on the laws to be put in force.
The evil was so wide-spreading, so violent and immedicable, that no care, no prevention could be judged superfluous, which even added a chance to our escape.
These were questions of prudence; there was no immediate necessity for an earnest caution.
England was still secure.
France, Germany, Italy and Spain, were interposed, walls yet without a breach, between us and the plague.
Our vessels truly were the sport of winds and waves, even as Gulliver was the toy of the Brobdignagians; but we on our stable abode could not be hurt in life or limb by these eruptions of nature.
We could not fear--we did not.
Yet a feeling of awe, a breathless sentiment of wonder, a painful sense of the degradation of humanity, was introduced into every heart.
Nature, our mother, and our friend, had turned on us a brow of menace.
She shewed us plainly, that, though she permitted us to assign her laws and subdue her apparent powers, yet, if she put forth but a finger, we must quake.
She could take our globe, fringed with mountains, girded by the atmosphere, containing the condition of our being, and all that man's mind could invent or his force achieve; she could take the ball in her hand, and cast it into space, where life would be
These speculations were rife among us; yet not the less we proceeded in our daily occupations, and our plans, whose accomplishment demanded the lapse of many years.
No voice was heard telling us to hold!
When foreign distresses came to be felt by us through the channels of commerce, we set ourselves to apply remedies.
Subscriptions were made for the emigrants, and merchants bankrupt by the failure of trade.
The English spirit awoke to its full activity, and, as it had ever done, set itself to resist the evil, and to stand in the breach which diseased nature had suffered chaos and death to make in the bounds and banks which had hitherto kept them out.
At the commencement of summer, we began to feel, that the mischief which had taken place in distant countries was greater than we had at first suspected.
Quito was destroyed by an earthquake.
Mexico laid waste by the united effects of storm, pestilence and famine.
Crowds of emigrants inundated the west of Europe; and our island had become the refuge of thousands.
In the mean time Ryland had been chosen Protector.
He had sought this office with eagerness, under the idea of turning his whole forces to the suppression of the privileged orders of our community.
His measures were thwarted, and his schemes interrupted by this new state of things.
Many of the foreigners were utterly destitute; and their increasing numbers at length forbade a recourse to the usual modes of relief.
Trade was stopped by the failure of the interchange of cargoes usual between us, and America, India, Egypt and Greece.
A sudden break was made in the routine of our lives.
In vain our Protector and his partizans sought to conceal this truth; in vain, day after day, he appointed a period for the discussion of the new laws concerning hereditary rank and privilege; in vain he endeavoured to represent the evil as partial and
These disasters came home to so many bosoms, and, through the various channels of commerce, were carried so entirely into every class and division of the community, that of necessity they became the first question in the state, the chief subjects to which
Can it be true, each asked the other with wonder and dismay, that whole countries are laid waste, whole nations annihilated, by these disorders in nature?
The vast cities of America, the fertile plains of Hindostan, the crowded abodes of the Chinese, are menaced with utter ruin.
Where late the busy multitudes assembled for pleasure or profit, now only the sound of wailing and misery is heard.
The air is empoisoned, and each human being inhales death, even while in youth and health, their hopes are in the flower.
We called to mind the plague of 1348, when it was calculated that a third of mankind had been destroyed.
As yet western Europe was uninfected; would it always be so?
O, yes, it would--Countrymen, fear not!
In the still uncultivated wilds of America, what wonder that among its other giant destroyers, Plague should be numbered!
It is of old a native of the East, sister of the tornado, the earthquake, and the simoon.
Child of the sun, and nursling of the tropics, it would expire in these climes.
It drinks the dark blood of the inhabitant of the south, but it never feasts on the pale-faced Celt.
If perchance some stricken Asiatic come among us, plague dies with him, uncommunicated and innoxious.
Let us weep for our brethren, though we can never experience their reverse.
Let us lament over and assist the children of the garden of the earth.
Late we envied their abodes, their spicy groves, fertile plains, and abundant loveliness.
But in this mortal life extremes are always matched; the thorn grows with the rose, the poison tree and the cinnamon mingle their boughs.
Persia, with its cloth of gold, marble halls, and infinite wealth, is now a tomb.
The tent of the Arab is fallen in the sands, and his horse spurns the ground unbridled and unsaddled.
The voice of lamentation fills the valley of Cashmere; its dells and woods, its cool fountains, and gardens of roses, are polluted by the dead; in Circassia and Georgia the spirit of beauty weeps over the ruin of its favourite temple--the form of woman.
Our own distresses, though they were occasioned by the fictitious reciprocity of commerce, encreased in due proportion.
Bankers, merchants, and manufacturers, whose trade depended on exports and interchange of wealth, became bankrupt.
Such things, when they happen singly, affect only the immediate parties; but the prosperity of the nation was now shaken by frequent and extensive losses.
Families, bred in opulence and luxury, were reduced to beggary.
The very state of peace in which we gloried was injurious; there were no means of employing the idle, or of sending any overplus of population out of the country.
Even the source of colonies was dried up, for in New Holland, Van Diemen's Land, and the Cape of Good Hope, plague raged.
O, for some medicinal vial to purge unwholesome nature, and bring back the earth to its accustomed health!
Ryland was a man of strong intellects and quick and sound decision in the usual course of things, but he stood aghast at the multitude of evils that gathered round us.
Must he tax the landed interest to assist our commercial population?
To do this, he must gain the favour of the chief land-holders, the nobility of the country; and these were his vowed enemies--he must conciliate them by abandoning his favourite scheme of equalization; he must confirm them in their manorial rights; he must
He must aim no more at the dear object of his ambition; throwing his arms aside, he must for present ends give up the ultimate object of his endeavours.
He came to Windsor to consult with us.
Every day added to his difficulties; the arrival of fresh vessels with emigrants, the total cessation of commerce, the starving multitude that thronged around the palace of the Protectorate, were circumstances not to be tampered with.
The blow was struck; the aristocracy obtained all they wished, and they subscribed to a twelvemonths' bill, which levied twenty per cent on all the rent-rolls of the country.
Calm was now restored to the metropolis, and to the populous cities, before driven to desperation; and we returned to the consideration of distant calamities, wondering if the future would bring any alleviation to their excess.
It was August; so there could be small hope of relief during the heats.
On the contrary, the disease gained virulence, while starvation did its accustomed work.
Thousands died unlamented; for beside the yet warm corpse the mourner was stretched, made mute by death.
On the eighteenth of this month news arrived in London that the plague was in France and Italy.
These tidings were at first whispered about town; but no one dared express aloud the soul-quailing intelligence.
When any one met a friend in the street, he only cried as he hurried on, "You know"!
-- while the other, with an ejaculation of fear and horror, would answer,-- "What will become of us"?
At length it was mentioned in the newspapers.
The paragraph was inserted in an obscure part: "We regret to state that there can be no longer a doubt of the plague having been introduced at Leghorn, Genoa, and Marseilles".
No word of comment followed; each reader made his own fearful one.
We were as a man who hears that his house is burning, and yet hurries through the streets, borne along by a lurking hope of a mistake, till he turns the corner, and sees his sheltering roof enveloped in a flame.
Before it had been a rumour; but now in words uneraseable, in definite and undeniable print, the knowledge went forth.
Its obscurity of situation rendered it the more conspicuous: the diminutive letters grew gigantic to the bewildered eye of fear: they seemed graven with a pen of iron, impressed by fire, woven in the clouds, stamped on the very front of the universe.
The English, whether travellers or residents, came pouring in one great revulsive stream, back on their own country; and with them crowds of Italians and Spaniards.
Our little island was filled even to bursting.
At first an unusual quantity of specie made its appearance with the emigrants; but these people had no means of receiving back into their hands what they spent among us.
With the advance of summer, and the increase of the distemper, rents were unpaid, and their remittances failed them.
It was impossible to see these crowds of wretched, perishing creatures, late nurslings of luxury, and not stretch out a hand to save them.
As at the conclusion of the eighteenth century, the English unlocked their hospitable store, for the relief of those driven from their homes by political revolution; so now they were not backward in affording aid to the victims of a more wide-spreading
We had many foreign friends whom we eagerly sought out, and relieved from dreadful penury.
Our Castle became an asylum for the unhappy.
A little population occupied its halls.
The revenue of its possessor, which had always found a mode of expenditure congenial to his generous nature, was now attended to more parsimoniously, that it might embrace a wider portion of utility.
It was not however money, except partially, but the necessaries of life, that became scarce.
It was difficult to find an immediate remedy.
The usual one of imports was entirely cut off.
In this emergency, to feed the very people to whom we had given refuge, we were obliged to yield to the plough and the mattock our pleasure-grounds and parks.
Live stock diminished sensibly in the country, from the effects of the great demand in the market.
Even the poor deer, our antlered proteges, were obliged to fall for the sake of worthier pensioners.
The labour necessary to bring the lands to this sort of culture, employed and fed the offcasts of the diminished manufactories.
Adrian did not rest only with the exertions he could make with regard to his own possessions.
He addressed himself to the wealthy of the land; he made proposals in parliament little adapted to please the rich; but his earnest pleadings and benevolent eloquence were irresistible.
To give up their pleasure-grounds to the agriculturist, to diminish sensibly the number of horses kept for the purposes of luxury throughout the country, were means obvious, but unpleasing.
Yet, to the honour of the English be it recorded, that, although natural disinclination made them delay awhile, yet when the misery of their fellow-creatures became glaring, an enthusiastic generosity inspired their decrees.
The most luxurious were often the first to part with their indulgencies.
As is common in communities, a fashion was set.
The high-born ladies of the country would have deemed themselves disgraced if they had now enjoyed, what they before called a necessary, the ease of a carriage.
Chairs, as in olden time, and Indian palanquins were introduced for the infirm; but else it was nothing singular to see females of rank going on foot to places of fashionable resort.
It was more common, for all who possessed landed property to secede to their estates, attended by whole troops of the indigent, to cut down their woods to erect temporary dwellings, and to portion out their parks, parterres and flower-gardens, to
Many of these, of high rank in their own countries, now, with hoe in hand, turned up the soil.
It was found necessary at last to check the spirit of sacrifice, and to remind those whose generosity proceeded to lavish waste, that, until the present state of things became permanent, of which there was no likelihood, it was wrong to carry change so far
Experience demonstrated that in a year or two pestilence would cease; it were well that in the mean time we should not have destroyed our fine breeds of horses, or have utterly changed the face of the ornamented portion of the country.
It may be imagined that things were in a bad state indeed, before this spirit of benevolence could have struck such deep roots.
The infection had now spread in the southern provinces of France.
But that country had so many resources in the way of agriculture, that the rush of population from one part of it to another, and its increase through foreign emigration, was less felt than with us.
The panic struck appeared of more injury, than disease and its natural concomitants.
Winter was hailed, a general and never-failing physician.
The embrowning woods, and swollen rivers, the evening mists, and morning frosts, were welcomed with gratitude.
The effects of purifying cold were immediately felt; and the lists of mortality abroad were curtailed each week.
Many of our visitors left us: those whose homes were far in the south, fled delightedly from our northern winter, and sought their native land, secure of plenty even after their fearful visitation.
We breathed again.
What the coming summer would bring, we knew not; but the present months were our own, and our hopes of a cessation of pestilence were high.

CHAPTER VI.
I HAVE lingered thus long on the extreme bank, the wasting shoal that stretched into the stream of life, dallying with the shadow of death.
Thus long, I have cradled my heart in retrospection of past happiness, when hope was.
Why not for ever thus?
I am not immortal; and the thread of my history might be spun out to the limits of my existence.
But the same sentiment that first led me to pourtray scenes replete with tender recollections, now bids me hurry on.
The same yearning of this warm, panting heart, that has made me in written words record my vagabond youth, my serene manhood, and the passions of my soul, makes me now recoil from further delay.
I must complete my work.
Here then I stand, as I said, beside the fleet waters of the flowing years, and now away!
Spread the sail, and strain with oar, hurrying by dark impending crags, adown steep rapids, even to the sea of desolation I have reached.
Yet one moment, one brief interval before I put from shore-- once, once again let me fancy myself as I was in 2094 in my abode at Windsor, let me close my eyes, and imagine that the immeasurable boughs of its oaks still shadow me, its castle walls anear.
Let fancy pourtray the joyous scene of the twentieth of June, such as even now my aching heart recalls it.
Circumstances had called me to London; here I heard talk that symptoms of the plague had occurred in hospitals of that city.
I returned to Windsor; my brow was clouded, my heart heavy; I entered the Little Park, as was my custom, at the Frogmore gate, on my way to the Castle.
A great part of these grounds had been given to cultivation, and strips of potatoe-land and corn were scattered here and there.
The rooks cawed loudly in the trees above; mixed with their hoarse cries I heard a lively strain of music.
It was Alfred's birthday.
The young people, the Etonians, and children of the neighbouring gentry, held a mock fair, to which all the country people were invited.
The park was speckled by tents, whose flaunting colours and gaudy flags, waving in the sunshine, added to the gaiety of the scene.
On a platform erected beneath the terrace, a number of the younger part of the assembly were dancing.
I leaned against a tree to observe them.
The band played the wild eastern air of Weber introduced in Abon Hassan; its volatile notes gave wings to the feet of the dancers, while the lookers-on unconsciously beat time.
At first the tripping measure lifted my spirit with it, and for a moment my eyes gladly followed the mazes of the dance.
The revulsion of thought passed like keen steel to my heart.
Ye are all going to die, I thought; already your tomb is built up around you.
Awhile, because you are gifted with agility and strength, you fancy that you live: but frail is the "bower of flesh" that encaskets life; dissoluble the silver cord than binds you to it.
The joyous soul, charioted from pleasure to pleasure by the graceful mechanism of well-formed limbs, will suddenly feel the axle-tree give way, and spring and wheel dissolve in dust.
Not one of you, O!
fated crowd, can escape--not one!
not my own ones!
not my Idris and her babes!
Horror and misery!
Already the gay dance vanished, the green sward was strewn with corpses, the blue air above became fetid with deathly exhalations.
Shriek, ye clarions!
ye loud trumpets, howl!
Pile dirge on dirge; rouse the funereal chords; let the air ring with dire wailing; let wild discord rush on the wings of the wind!
Already I hear it, while guardian angels, attendant on humanity, their task achieved, hasten away, and their departure is announced by melancholy strains; faces all unseemly with weeping, forced open my lids; faster and faster many groups of these
Ashy pale, Raymond and Perdita sat apart, looking on with sad smiles.
Adrian's countenance flitted across, tainted by death--Idris, with eyes languidly closed and livid lips, was about to slide into the wide grave.
The confusion grew--their looks of sorrow changed to mockery; they nodded their heads in time to the music, whose clang became maddening.
I felt that this was insanity--I sprang forward to throw it off; I rushed into the midst of the crowd.
Idris saw me: with light step she advanced; as I folded her in my arms, feeling, as I did, that I thus enclosed what was to me a world, yet frail as the waterdrop which the noon-day sun will drink from the water lily's cup; tears filled my eyes, unwont to
The joyful welcome of my boys, the soft gratulation of Clara, the pressure of Adrian's hand, contributed to unman me.
I felt that they were near, that they were safe, yet methought this was all deceit;--the earth reeled, the firm-enrooted trees moved--dizziness came over me--I sank to the ground.
My beloved friends were alarmed--nay, they expressed their alarm so anxiously, that I dared not pronounce the word plague, that hovered on my lips, lest they should construe my perturbed looks into a symptom, and see infection in my languor.
I had scarcely recovered, and with feigned hilarity had brought back smiles into my little circle, when we saw Ryland approach.
Ryland had something the appearance of a farmer; of a man whose muscles and full grown stature had been developed under the influence of vigorous exercise and exposure to the elements.
This was to a great degree the case: for, though a large landed proprietor, yet, being a projector, and of an ardent and industrious disposition, he had on his own estate given himself up to agricultural labours.
When he went as ambassador to the Northern States of America, he, for some time, planned his entire migration; and went so far as to make several journies far westward on that immense continent, for the purpose of choosing the site of his new abode.
Ambition turned his thoughts from these designs--ambition, which labouring through various lets and hindrances, had now led him to the summit of his hopes, in making him Lord Protector of England.
His countenance was rough but intelligent--his ample brow and quick grey eyes seemed to look out, over his own plans, and the opposition of his enemies.
His voice was stentorian: his hand stretched out in debate, seemed by its gigantic and muscular form, to warn his hearers that words were not his only weapons.
Few people had discovered some cowardice and much infirmity of purpose under this imposing exterior.
No man could crush a "butterfly on the wheel" with better effect; no man better cover a speedy retreat from a powerful adversary.
This had been the secret of his secession at the time of Lord Raymond's election.
In the unsteady glance of his eye, in his extreme desire to learn the opinions of all, in the feebleness of his hand-writing, these qualities might be obscurely traced, but they were not generally known.
He was now our Lord Protector.
He had canvassed eagerly for this post.
His protectorate was to be distinguished by every kind of innovation on the aristocracy.
This his selected task was exchanged for the far different one of encountering the ruin caused by the convulsions of physical nature.
He was incapable of meeting these evils by any comprehensive system; he had resorted to expedient after expedient, and could never be induced to put a remedy in force, till it came too late to be of use.
Certainly the Ryland that advanced towards us now, bore small resemblance to the powerful, ironical, seemingly fearless canvasser for the first rank among Englishmen.
Our native oak, as his partisans called him, was visited truly by a nipping winter.
He scarcely appeared half his usual height; his joints were unknit, his limbs would not support him; his face was contracted, his eye wandering; debility of purpose and dastard fear were expressed in every gesture.
In answer to our eager questions, one word alone fell, as it were involuntarily, from his convulsed lips: The Plague.
--"Where"?
--"Every where--we must fly--all fly--but whither?
No man can tell--there is no refuge on earth, it comes on us like a thousand packs of wolves--we must all fly--where shall you go?
Where can any of us go"?
These words were syllabled trembling by the iron man.
Adrian replied, "Whither indeed would you fly?
We must all remain; and do our best to help our suffering fellow-creatures".
"Help"!
said Ryland, "there is no help!
--great God, who talks of help!
All the world has the plague"!
"Then to avoid it, we must quit the world," observed Adrian, with a gentle smile.
Ryland groaned; cold drops stood on his brow.
It was useless to oppose his paroxysm of terror: but we soothed and encouraged him, so that after an interval he was better able to explain to us the ground of his alarm.
It had come sufficiently home to him.
One of his servants, while waiting on him, had suddenly fallen down dead.
The physician declared that he died of the plague.
We endeavoured to calm him--but our own hearts were not calm.
I saw the eye of Idris wander from me to her children, with an anxious appeal to my judgment.
Adrian was absorbed in meditation.
For myself, I own that Ryland's words rang in my ears; all the world was infected;--in what uncontaminated seclusion could I save my beloved treasures, until the shadow of death had passed from over the earth?
We sunk into silence: a silence that drank in the doleful accounts and prognostications of our guest.
We had receded from the crowd; and ascending the steps of the terrace, sought the Castle.
Our change of cheer struck those nearest to us; and, by means of Ryland's servants, the report soon spread that he had fled from the plague in London.
The sprightly parties broke up--they assembled in whispering groups.
The spirit of gaiety was eclipsed; the music ceased; the young people left their occupations and gathered together.
The lightness of heart which had dressed them in masquerade habits, had decorated their tents, and assembled them in fantastic groups, appeared a sin against, and a provocative to, the awful destiny that had laid its palsying hand upon hope and life.
The merriment of the hour was an unholy mockery of the sorrows of man.
The foreigners whom we had among us, who had fled from the plague in their own country, now saw their last asylum invaded; and, fear making them garrulous, they described to eager listeners the miseries they had beheld in cities visited by the calamity,
We had entered the Castle.
Idris stood at a window that over-looked the park; her maternal eyes sought her own children among the young crowd.
An Italian lad had got an audience about him, and with animated gestures was describing some scene of horror.
Alfred stood immoveable before him, his whole attention absorbed.
Little Evelyn had endeavoured to draw Clara away to play with him; but the Italian's tale arrested her, she crept near, her lustrous eyes fixed on the speaker.
Either watching the crowd in the park, or occupied by painful reflection, we were all silent; Ryland stood by himself in an embrasure of the window; Adrian paced the hall, revolving some new and overpowering idea--suddenly he stopped and said: "I have long
The evil is come home to us, and we must not shrink from our fate.
What are your plans, my Lord Protector, for the benefit of our country"?
"For heaven's love!
Windsor," cried Ryland, "do not mock me with that title.
Death and disease level all men.
I neither pretend to protect nor govern an hospital--such will England quickly become".
"Do you then intend, now in time of peril, to recede from your duties"?
"Duties!
speak rationally, my Lord!
--when I am a plague-spotted corpse, where will my duties be?
Every man for himself!
the devil take the protectorship, say I, if it expose me to danger"!
"Faint-hearted man"!
cried Adrian indignantly--"Your countrymen put their trust in you, and you betray them"!
"I betray them"!
said Ryland, "the plague betrays me.
Faint-hearted!
It is well, shut up in your castle, out of danger, to boast yourself out of fear.
Take the Protectorship who will; before God I renounce it"!
"And before God," replied his opponent, fervently, "do I receive it!
No one will canvass for this honour now--none envy my danger or labours.
Deposit your powers in my hands.
Long have I fought with death, and much" (he stretched out his thin hand) "much have I suffered in the struggle.
It is not by flying, but by facing the enemy, that we can conquer.
If my last combat is now about to be fought, and I am to be worsted--so let it be"!
"But come, Ryland, recollect yourself!
Men have hitherto thought you magnanimous and wise, will you cast aside these titles?
Consider the panic your departure will occasion.
Return to London.
I will go with you.
Encourage the people by your presence.
I will incur all the danger.
Shame!
shame!
if the first magistrate of England be foremost to renounce his duties".
Meanwhile among our guests in the park, all thoughts of festivity had faded.
As summer-flies are scattered by rain, so did this congregation, late noisy and happy, in sadness and melancholy murmurs break up, dwindling away apace.
With the set sun and the deepening twilight the park became nearly empty.
Adrian and Ryland were still in earnest discussion.
We had prepared a banquet for our guests in the lower hall of the castle; and thither Idris and I repaired to receive and entertain the few that remained.
There is nothing more melancholy than a merry-meeting thus turned to sorrow: the gala dresses--the decorations, gay as they might otherwise be, receive a solemn and funereal appearance.
If such change be painful from lighter causes, it weighed with intolerable heaviness from the knowledge that the earth's desolator had at last, even as an arch-fiend, lightly over-leaped the boundaries our precautions raised, and at once enthroned himself
Idris sat at the top of the half-empty hall.
Pale and tearful, she almost forgot her duties as hostess; her eyes were fixed on her children.
Alfred's serious air shewed that he still revolved the tragic story related by the Italian boy.
Evelyn was the only mirthful creature present: he sat on Clara's lap; and, making matter of glee from his own fancies, laughed aloud.
The vaulted roof echoed again his infant tone.
The poor mother who had brooded long over, and suppressed the expression of her anguish, now burst into tears, and folding her babe in her arms, hurried from the hall.
Clara and Alfred followed.
While the rest of the company, in confused murmur, which grew louder and louder, gave voice to their many fears.
The younger part gathered round me to ask my advice; and those who had friends in London were anxious beyond the rest, to ascertain the present extent of disease in the metropolis.
I encouraged them with such thoughts of cheer as presented themselves.
I told them exceedingly few deaths had yet been occasioned by pestilence, and gave them hopes, as we were the last visited, so the calamity might have lost its most venomous power before it had reached us.
The cleanliness, habits of order, and the manner in which our cities were built, were all in our favour.
As it was an epidemic, its chief force was derived from pernicious qualities in the air, and it would probably do little harm where this was naturally salubrious.
At first, I had spoken only to those nearest me; but the whole assembly gathered about me, and I found that I was listened to by all.
"My friends," I said, "our risk is common; our precautions and exertions shall be common also.
If manly courage and resistance can save us, we will be saved.
We will fight the enemy to the last.
Plague shall not find us a ready prey; we will dispute every inch of ground; and, by methodical and inflexible laws, pile invincible barriers to the progress of our foe.
Perhaps in no part of the world has she met with so systematic and determined an opposition.
Perhaps no country is naturally so well protected against our invader; nor has nature anywhere been so well assisted by the hand of man.
We will not despair.
We are neither cowards nor fatalists; but, believing that God has placed the means for our preservation in our own hands, we will use those means to our utmost.
Remember that cleanliness, sobriety, and even good-humour and benevolence, are our best medicines".
There was little I could add to this general exhortation; for the plague, though in London, was not among us.
I dismissed the guests therefore; and they went thoughtful, more than sad, to await the events in store for them.
I now sought Adrian, anxious to hear the result of his discussion with Ryland.
He had in part prevailed; the Lord Protector consented to return to London for a few weeks; during which time things should be so arranged, as to occasion less consternation at his departure.
Adrian and Idris were together.
The sadness with which the former had first heard that the plague was in London had vanished; the energy of his purpose informed his body with strength, the solemn joy of enthusiasm and self-devotion illuminated his countenance; and the weakness of his
He was endeavouring to encourage his sister, and to bring her to look on his intent in a less tragic light than she was prepared to do; and with passionate eloquence he unfolded his designs to her.
"Let me, at the first word," he said, "relieve your mind from all fear on my account.
I will not task myself beyond my powers, nor will I needlessly seek danger.
I feel that I know what ought to be done, and as my presence is necessary for the accomplishment of my plans, I will take especial care to preserve my life.
"I am now going to undertake an office fitted for me.
I cannot intrigue, or work a tortuous path through the labyrinth of men's vices and passions; but I can bring patience, and sympathy, and such aid as art affords, to the bed of disease; I can raise from earth the miserable orphan, and awaken to new hopes
I can enchain the plague in limits, and set a term to the misery it would occasion; courage, forbearance, and watchfulness, are the forces I bring towards this great work.
"O, I shall be something now!
From my birth I have aspired like the eagle --but, unlike the eagle, my wings have failed, and my vision has been blinded.
Disappointment and sickness have hitherto held dominion over me; twin born with me, my would, was for ever enchained by the shall not, of these my tyrants.
A shepherd-boy that tends a silly flock on the mountains, was more in the scale of society than I. Congratulate me then that I have found fitting scope for my powers.
I have often thought of offering my services to the pestilence-stricken towns of France and Italy; but fear of paining you, and expectation of this catastrophe, withheld me.
To England and to Englishmen I dedicate myself.
If I can save one of her mighty spirits from the deadly shaft; if I can ward disease from one of her smiling cottages, I shall not have lived in vain".
Strange ambition this!
Yet such was Adrian.
He appeared given up to contemplation, averse to excitement, a lowly student, a man of visions-- but afford him worthy theme, and-- Like to the lark at break of day arising, From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate.
[1] so did he spring up from listlessness and unproductive thought, to the highest pitch of virtuous action.
With him went enthusiasm, the high-wrought resolve, the eye that without blenching could look at death.
With us remained sorrow, anxiety, and unendurable expectation of evil.
The man, says Lord Bacon, who hath wife and children, has given hostages to fortune.
Vain was all philosophical reasoning--vain all fortitude--vain, vain, a reliance on probable good.
I might heap high the scale with logic, courage, and resignation--but let one fear for Idris and our children enter the opposite one, and, over-weighed, it kicked the beam.
The plague was in London!
Fools that we were not long ago to have foreseen this.
We wept over the ruin of the boundless continents of the east, and the desolation of the western world; while we fancied that the little channel between our island and the rest of the earth was to preserve us alive among the dead.
It were no mighty leap methinks from Calais to Dover.
The eye easily discerns the sister land; they were united once; and the little path that runs between looks in a map but as a trodden footway through high grass.
Yet this small interval was to save us: the sea was to rise a wall of adamant--without, disease and misery--within, a shelter from evil, a nook of the garden of paradise--a particle of celestial soil, which no evil could invade--truly we were wise in our
But we are awake now.
The plague is in London; the air of England is tainted, and her sons and daughters strew the unwholesome earth.
And now, the sea, late our defence, seems our prison bound; hemmed in by its gulphs, we shall die like the famished inhabitants of a besieged town.
Other nations have a fellowship in death; but we, shut out from all neighbourhood, must bury our own dead, and little England become a wide, wide tomb.
This feeling of universal misery assumed concentration and shape, when I looked on my wife and children; and the thought of danger to them possessed my whole being with fear.
How could I save them?
I revolved a thousand and a thousand plans.
They should not die--first I would be gathered to nothingness, ere infection should come anear these idols of my soul.
I would walk barefoot through the world, to find an uninfected spot; I would build my home on some wave-tossed plank, drifted about on the barren, shoreless ocean.
I would betake me with them to some wild beast's den, where a tyger's cubs, which I would slay, had been reared in health.
I would seek the mountain eagle's eirie, and live years suspended in some inaccessible recess of a sea-bounding cliff--no labour too great, no scheme too wild, if it promised life to them.
O!
ye heart-strings of mine, could ye be torn asunder, and my soul not spend itself in tears of blood for sorrow!
Idris, after the first shock, regained a portion of fortitude.
She studiously shut out all prospect of the future, and cradled her heart in present blessings.
She never for a moment lost sight of her children.
But while they in health sported about her, she could cherish contentment and hope.
A strange and wild restlessness came over me--the more intolerable, because I was forced to conceal it.
My fears for Adrian were ceaseless; August had come; and the symptoms of plague encreased rapidly in London.
It was deserted by all who possessed the power of removing; and he, the brother of my soul, was exposed to the perils from which all but slaves enchained by circumstance fled.
He remained to combat the fiend--his side unguarded, his toils unshared--infection might even reach him, and he die unattended and alone.
By day and night these thoughts pursued me.
I resolved to visit London, to see him; to quiet these agonizing throes by the sweet medicine of hope, or the opiate of despair.
It was not until I arrived at Brentford, that I perceived much change in the face of the country.
The better sort of houses were shut up; the busy trade of the town palsied; there was an air of anxiety among the few passengers I met, and they looked wonderingly at my carriage--the first they had seen pass towards London, since pestilence sat on its
I met several funerals; they were slenderly attended by mourners, and were regarded by the spectators as omens of direst import.
Some gazed on these processions with wild eagerness-- others fled timidly--some wept aloud.
Adrian's chief endeavour, after the immediate succour of the sick, had been to disguise the symptoms and progress of the plague from the inhabitants of London.
He knew that fear and melancholy forebodings were powerful assistants to disease; that desponding and brooding care rendered the physical nature of man peculiarly susceptible of infection.
No unseemly sights were therefore discernible: the shops were in general open, the concourse of passengers in some degree kept up.
But although the appearance of an infected town was avoided, to me, who had not beheld it since the commencement of the visitation, London appeared sufficiently changed.
There were no carriages, and grass had sprung high in the streets; the houses had a desolate look; most of the shutters were closed; and there was a ghast and frightened stare in the persons I met, very different from the usual business-like demeanour of
My solitary carriage attracted notice, as it rattled along towards the Protectoral Palace--and the fashionable streets leading to it wore a still more dreary and deserted appearance.
I found Adrian's anti-chamber crowded--it was his hour for giving audience.
I was unwilling to disturb his labours, and waited, watching the ingress and egress of the petitioners.
They consisted of people of the middling and lower classes of society, whose means of subsistence failed with the cessation of trade, and of the busy spirit of money-making in all its branches, peculiar to our country.
There was an air of anxiety, sometimes of terror in the new-comers, strongly contrasted with the resigned and even satisfied mien of those who had had audience.
I could read the influence of my friend in their quickened motions and cheerful faces.
Two o'clock struck, after which none were admitted; those who had been disappointed went sullenly or sorrowfully away, while I entered the audience-chamber.
I was struck by the improvement that appeared in the health of Adrian.
He was no longer bent to the ground, like an over-nursed flower of spring, that, shooting up beyond its strength, is weighed down even by its own coronal of blossoms.
His eyes were bright, his countenance composed, an air of concentrated energy was diffused over his whole person, much unlike its former languor.
He sat at a table with several secretaries, who were arranging petitions, or registering the notes made during that day's audience.
Two or three petitioners were still in attendance.
I admired his justice and patience.
Those who possessed a power of living out of London, he advised immediately to quit it, affording them the means of so doing.
Others, whose trade was beneficial to the city, or who possessed no other refuge, he provided with advice for better avoiding the epidemic; relieving overloaded families, supplying the gaps made in others by death.
Order, comfort, and even health, rose under his influence, as from the touch of a magician's wand.
"I am glad you are come," he said to me, when we were at last alone; "I can only spare a few minutes, and must tell you much in that time.
The plague is now in progress--it is useless closing one's eyes to the fact--the deaths encrease each week.
What will come I cannot guess.
As yet, thank God, I am equal to the government of the town; and I look only to the present.
Ryland, whom I have so long detained, has stipulated that I shall suffer him to depart before the end of this month.
The deputy appointed by parliament is dead; another therefore must be named; I have advanced my claim, and I believe that I shall have no competitor.
To-night the question is to be decided, as there is a call of the house for the purpose.
You must nominate me, Lionel; Ryland, for shame, cannot shew himself; but you, my friend, will do me this service?
How lovely is devotion!
Here was a youth, royally sprung, bred in luxury, by nature averse to the usual struggles of a public life, and now, in time of danger, at a period when to live was the utmost scope of the ambitious, he, the beloved and heroic Adrian, made, in sweet
The very idea was generous and noble,--but, beyond this, his unpretending manner, his entire want of the assumption of a virtue, rendered his act ten times more touching.
I would have withstood his request; but I had seen the good he diffused; I felt that his resolves were not to be shaken, so, with an heavy heart, I consented to do as he asked.
He grasped my hand affectionately:--"Thank you," he said, "you have relieved me from a painful dilemma, and are, as you ever were, the best of my friends.
Farewell--I must now leave you for a few hours.
Go you and converse with Ryland.
Although he deserts his post in London, he may be of the greatest service in the north of England, by receiving and assisting travellers, and contributing to supply the metropolis with food.
Awaken him, I entreat you, to some sense of duty".
Adrian left me, as I afterwards learnt, upon his daily task of visiting the hospitals, and inspecting the crowded parts of London.
I found Ryland much altered, even from what he had been when he visited Windsor.
Perpetual fear had jaundiced his complexion, and shrivelled his whole person.
I told him of the business of the evening, and a smile relaxed the contracted muscles.
He desired to go; each day he expected to be infected by pestilence, each day he was unable to resist the gentle violence of Adrian's detention.
The moment Adrian should be legally elected his deputy, he would escape to safety.
Under this impression he listened to all I said; and, elevated almost to joy by the near prospect of his departure, he entered into a discussion concerning the plans he should adopt in his own county, forgetting, for the moment, his cherished resolution of
In the evening, Adrian and I proceeded to Westminster.
As we went he reminded me of what I was to say and do, yet, strange to say, I entered the chamber without having once reflected on my purpose.
Adrian remained in the coffee-room, while I, in compliance with his desire, took my seat in St. Stephen's.
There reigned unusual silence in the chamber.
I had not visited it since Raymond's protectorate; a period conspicuous for a numerous attendance of members, for the eloquence of the speakers, and the warmth of the debate.
The benches were very empty, those by custom occupied by the hereditary members were vacant; the city members were there--the members for the commercial towns, few landed proprietors, and not many of those who entered parliament for the sake of a career.
The first subject that occupied the attention of the house was an address from the Lord Protector, praying them to appoint a deputy during a necessary absence on his part.
A silence prevailed, till one of the members coming to me, whispered that the Earl of Windsor had sent him word that I was to move his election, in the absence of the person who had been first chosen for this office.
Now for the first time I saw the full extent of my task, and I was overwhelmed by what I had brought on myself.
Ryland had deserted his post through fear of the plague: from the same fear Adrian had no competitor.
And I, the nearest kinsman of the Earl of Windsor, was to propose his election.
I was to thrust this selected and matchless friend into the post of danger-- impossible!
the die was cast--I would offer myself as candidate.
The few members who were present, had come more for the sake of terminating the business by securing a legal attendance, than under the idea of a debate.
I had risen mechanically--my knees trembled; irresolution hung on my voice, as I uttered a few words on the necessity of choosing a person adequate to the dangerous task in hand.
But, when the idea of presenting myself in the room of my friend intruded, the load of doubt and pain was taken from off me.
My words flowed spontaneously--my utterance was firm and quick.
I adverted to what Adrian had already done--I promised the same vigilance in furthering all his views.
I drew a touching picture of his vacillating health; I boasted of my own strength.
I prayed them to save even from himself this scion of the noblest family in England.
My alliance with him was the pledge of my sincerity, my union with his sister, my children, his presumptive heirs, were the hostages of my truth.
This unexpected turn in the debate was quickly communicated to Adrian.
He hurried in, and witnessed the termination of my impassioned harangue.
I did not see him: my soul was in my words,--my eyes could not perceive that which was; while a vision of Adrian's form, tainted by pestilence, and sinking in death, floated before them.
He seized my hand, as I concluded-- "Unkind"!
he cried, "you have betrayed me"!
then, springing forwards, with the air of one who had a right to command, he claimed the place of deputy as his own.
He had bought it, he said, with danger, and paid for it with toil.
His ambition rested there; and, after an interval devoted to the interests of his country, was I to step in, and reap the profit?
Let them remember what London had been when he arrived: the panic that prevailed brought famine, while every moral and legal tie was loosened.
He had restored order--this had been a work which required perseverance, patience, and energy; and he had neither slept nor waked but for the good of his country.
--Would they dare wrong him thus?
Would they wrest his hard-earned reward from him, to bestow it on one, who, never having mingled in public life, would come a tyro to the craft, in which he was an adept.
He demanded the place of deputy as his right.
Ryland had shewn that he preferred him.
Never before had he, who was born even to the inheritance of the throne of England, never had he asked favour or honour from those now his equals, but who might have been his subjects.
Would they refuse him?
Could they thrust back from the path of distinction and laudable ambition, the heir of their ancient kings, and heap another disappointment on a fallen house.
No one had ever before heard Adrian allude to the rights of his ancestors.
None had ever before suspected, that power, or the suffrage of the many, could in any manner become dear to him.
He had begun his speech with vehemence; he ended with unassuming gentleness, making his appeal with the same humility, as if he had asked to be the first in wealth, honour, and power among Englishmen, and not, as was the truth, to be the foremost in the
A murmur of approbation rose after his speech.
"Oh, do not listen to him," I cried, "he speaks false--false to himself,"--I was interrupted: and, silence being restored, we were ordered, as was the custom, to retire during the decision of the house.
I fancied that they hesitated, and that there was some hope for me--I was mistaken--hardly had we quitted the chamber, before Adrian was recalled, and installed in his office of Lord Deputy to the Protector.
We returned together to the palace.
"Why, Lionel," said Adrian, "what did you intend?
you could not hope to conquer, and yet you gave me the pain of a triumph over my dearest friend".
"This is mockery," I replied, "you devote yourself,--you, the adored brother of Idris, the being, of all the world contains, dearest to our hearts--you devote yourself to an early death.
I would have prevented this; my death would be a small evil--or rather I should not die; while you cannot hope to escape".
"As to the likelihood of escaping," said Adrian, "ten years hence the cold stars may shine on the graves of all of us; but as to my peculiar liability to infection, I could easily prove, both logically and physically, that in the midst of contagion I have
"This is my post: I was born for this--to rule England in anarchy, to save her in danger--to devote myself for her.
The blood of my forefathers cries aloud in my veins, and bids me be first among my countrymen.
Or, if this mode of speech offend you, let me say, that my mother, the proud queen, instilled early into me a love of distinction, and all that, if the weakness of my physical nature and my peculiar opinions had not prevented such a design, might have made
But now my mother, or, if you will, my mother's lessons, awaken within me.
I cannot lead on to battle; I cannot, through intrigue and faithlessness rear again the throne upon the wreck of English public spirit.
But I can be the first to support and guard my country, now that terrific disasters and ruin have laid strong hands upon her.
"That country and my beloved sister are all I have.
I will protect the first--the latter I commit to your charge.
If I survive, and she be lost, I were far better dead.
Preserve her--for her own sake I know that you will--if you require any other spur, think that, in preserving her, you preserve me.
Her faultless nature, one sum of perfections, is wrapt up in her affections--if they were hurt, she would droop like an unwatered floweret, and the slightest injury they receive is a nipping frost to her.
Already she fears for us.
She fears for the children she adores, and for you, the father of these, her lover, husband, protector; and you must be near her to support and encourage her.
Return to Windsor then, my brother; for such you are by every tie--fill the double place my absence imposes on you, and let me, in all my sufferings here, turn my eyes towards that dear seclusion, and say--There is peace".

CHAPTER VII.
I DID proceed to Windsor, but not with the intention of remaining there.
I went but to obtain the consent of Idris, and then to return and take my station beside my unequalled friend; to share his labours, and save him, if so it must be, at the expence of my life.
Yet I dreaded to witness the anguish which my resolve might excite in Idris.
I had vowed to my own heart never to shadow her countenance even with transient grief, and should I prove recreant at the hour of greatest need?
I had begun my journey with anxious haste; now I desired to draw it out through the course of days and months.
I longed to avoid the necessity of action; I strove to escape from thought--vainly--futurity, like a dark image in a phantasmagoria, came nearer and more near, till it clasped the whole earth in its shadow.
A slight circumstance induced me to alter my usual route, and to return home by Egham and Bishopgate.
I alighted at Perdita's ancient abode, her cottage; and, sending forward the carriage, determined to walk across the park to the castle.
This spot, dedicated to sweetest recollections, the deserted house and neglected garden were well adapted to nurse my melancholy.
In our happiest days, Perdita had adorned her cottage with every aid art might bring, to that which nature had selected to favour.
In the same spirit of exaggeration she had, on the event of her separation from Raymond, caused it to be entirely neglected.
It was now in ruin: the deer had climbed the broken palings, and reposed among the flowers; grass grew on the threshold, and the swinging lattice creaking to the wind, gave signal of utter desertion.
The sky was blue above, and the air impregnated with fragrance by the rare flowers that grew among the weeds.
The trees moved overhead, awakening nature's favourite melody--but the melancholy appearance of the choaked paths, and weed-grown flower-beds, dimmed even this gay summer scene.
The time when in proud and happy security we assembled at this cottage, was gone--soon the present hours would join those past, and shadows of future ones rose dark and menacing from the womb of time, their cradle and their bier.
For the first time in my life I envied the sleep of the dead, and thought with pleasure of one's bed under the sod, where grief and fear have no power.
I passed through the gap of the broken paling--I felt, while I disdained, the choaking tears--I rushed into the depths of the forest.
O death and change, rulers of our life, where are ye, that I may grapple with you!
What was there in our tranquillity, that excited your envy--in our happiness, that ye should destroy it?
We were happy, loving, and beloved; the horn of Amalthea contained no blessing unshowered upon us, but, alas!
la fortuna deidad barbara importuna, oy cadaver y ayer flor, no permanece jamas!
[1] As I wandered on thus ruminating, a number of country people passed me.
They seemed full of careful thought, and a few words of their conversation that reached me, induced me to approach and make further enquiries.
A party of people flying from London, as was frequent in those days, had come up the Thames in a boat.
No one at Windsor would afford them shelter; so, going a little further up, they remained all night in a deserted hut near Bolter's lock.
They pursued their way the following morning, leaving one of their company behind them, sick of the plague.
This circumstance once spread abroad, none dared approach within half a mile of the infected neighbourhood, and the deserted wretch was left to fight with disease and death in solitude, as he best might.
I was urged by compassion to hasten to the hut, for the purpose of ascertaining his situation, and administering to his wants.
As I advanced I met knots of country-people talking earnestly of this event: distant as they were from the apprehended contagion, fear was impressed on every countenance.
I passed by a group of these terrorists, in a lane in the direct road to the hut.
One of them stopped me, and, conjecturing that I was ignorant of the circumstance, told me not to go on, for that an infected person lay but at a short distance.
"I know it," I replied, "and I am going to see in what condition the poor fellow is".
A murmur of surprise and horror ran through the assembly.
I continued:-- "This poor wretch is deserted, dying, succourless; in these unhappy times, God knows how soon any or all of us may be in like want.
I am going to do, as I would be done by".
"But you will never be able to return to the Castle--Lady Idris--his children--" in confused speech were the words that struck my ear.
"Do you not know, my friends," I said, "that the Earl himself, now Lord Protector, visits daily, not only those probably infected by this disease, but the hospitals and pest houses, going near, and even touching the sick?
yet he was never in better health.
You labour under an entire mistake as to the nature of the plague; but do not fear, I do not ask any of you to accompany me, nor to believe me, until I return safe and sound from my patient".
So I left them, and hurried on.
I soon arrived at the hut: the door was ajar.
I entered, and one glance assured me that its former inhabitant was no more--he lay on a heap of straw, cold and stiff; while a pernicious effluvia filled the room, and various stains and marks served to shew the virulence of the disorder.
I had never before beheld one killed by pestilence.
While every mind was full of dismay at its effects, a craving for excitement had led us to peruse De Foe's account, and the masterly delineations of the author of Arthur Mervyn.
The pictures drawn in these books were so vivid, that we seemed to have experienced the results depicted by them.
But cold were the sensations excited by words, burning though they were, and describing the death and misery of thousands, compared to what I felt in looking on the corpse of this unhappy stranger.
This indeed was the plague.
I raised his rigid limbs, I marked the distortion of his face, and the stony eyes lost to perception.
As I was thus occupied, chill horror congealed my blood, making my flesh quiver and my hair to stand on end.
Half insanely I spoke to the dead.
So the plague killed you, I muttered.
How came this?
Was the coming painful?
You look as if the enemy had tortured, before he murdered you.
And now I leapt up precipitately, and escaped from the hut, before nature could revoke her laws, and inorganic words be breathed in answer from the lips of the departed.
On returning through the lane, I saw at a distance the same assemblage of persons which I had left.
They hurried away, as soon as they saw me; my agitated mien added to their fear of coming near one who had entered within the verge of contagion.
At a distance from facts one draws conclusions which appear infallible, which yet when put to the test of reality, vanish like unreal dreams.
I had ridiculed the fears of my countrymen, when they related to others; now that they came home to myself, I paused.
The Rubicon, I felt, was passed; and it behoved me well to reflect what I should do on this hither side of disease and danger.
According to the vulgar superstition, my dress, my person, the air I breathed, bore in it mortal danger to myself and others.
Should I return to the Castle, to my wife and children, with this taint upon me?
Not surely if I were infected; but I felt certain that I was not--a few hours would determine the question--I would spend these in the forest, in reflection on what was to come, and what my future actions were to be.
In the feeling communicated to me by the sight of one struck by the plague, I forgot the events that had excited me so strongly in London; new and more painful prospects, by degrees were cleared of the mist which had hitherto veiled them.
The question was no longer whether I should share Adrian's toils and danger; but in what manner I could, in Windsor and the neighbourhood, imitate the prudence and zeal which, under his government, produced order and plenty in London, and how, now
I spread the whole earth out as a map before me.
On no one spot of its surface could I put my finger and say, here is safety.
In the south, the disease, virulent and immedicable, had nearly annihilated the race of man; storm and inundation, poisonous winds and blights, filled up the measure of suffering.
In the north it was worse--the lesser population gradually declined, and famine and plague kept watch on the survivors, who, helpless and feeble, were ready to fall an easy prey into their hands.
I contracted my view to England.
The overgrown metropolis, the great heart of mighty Britain, was pulseless.
Commerce had ceased.
All resort for ambition or pleasure was cut off--the streets were grass-grown--the houses empty--the few, that from necessity remained, seemed already branded with the taint of inevitable pestilence.
In the larger manufacturing towns the same tragedy was acted on a smaller, yet more disastrous scale.
There was no Adrian to superintend and direct, while whole flocks of the poor were struck and killed.
Yet we were not all to die.
No truly, though thinned, the race of man would continue, and the great plague would, in after years, become matter of history and wonder.
Doubtless this visitation was for extent unexampled--more need that we should work hard to dispute its progress; ere this men have gone out in sport, and slain their thousands and tens of thousands; but now man had become a creature of price; the life of
Look at his thought-endued countenance, his graceful limbs, his majestic brow, his wondrous mechanism--the type and model of this best work of God is not to be cast aside as a broken vessel--he shall be preserved, and his children and his children's
Above all I must guard those entrusted by nature and fate to my especial care.
And surely, if among all my fellow-creatures I were to select those who might stand forth examples of the greatness and goodness of man, I could choose no other than those allied to me by the most sacred ties.
Some from among the family of man must survive, and these should be among the survivors; that should be my task--to accomplish it my own life were a small sacrifice.
There then in that castle--in Windsor Castle, birth-place of Idris and my babes, should be the haven and retreat for the wrecked bark of human society.
Its forest should be our world--its garden afford us food; within its walls I would establish the shaken throne of health.
I was an outcast and a vagabond, when Adrian gently threw over me the silver net of love and civilization, and linked me inextricably to human charities and human excellence.
I was one, who, though an aspirant after good, and an ardent lover of wisdom, was yet unenrolled in any list of worth, when Idris, the princely born, who was herself the personification of all that was divine in woman, she who walked the earth like a
During several hours I continued thus to meditate, till hunger and fatigue brought me back to the passing hour, then marked by long shadows cast from the descending sun.
I had wandered towards Bracknel, far to the west of Windsor.
The feeling of perfect health which I enjoyed, assured me that I was free from contagion.
I remembered that Idris had been kept in ignorance of my proceedings.
She might have heard of my return from London, and my visit to Bolter's Lock, which, connected with my continued absence, might tend greatly to alarm her.
I returned to Windsor by the Long Walk, and passing through the town towards the Castle, I found it in a state of agitation and disturbance.
"It is too late to be ambitious," says Sir Thomas Browne.
"We cannot hope to live so long in our names as some have done in their persons; one face of Janus holds no proportion to the other".
Upon this text many fanatics arose, who prophesied that the end of time was come.
The spirit of superstition had birth, from the wreck of our hopes, and antics wild and dangerous were played on the great theatre, while the remaining particle of futurity dwindled into a point in the eyes of the prognosticators.
Weak-spirited women died of fear as they listened to their denunciations; men of robust form and seeming strength fell into idiotcy and madness, racked by the dread of coming eternity.
A man of this kind was now pouring forth his eloquent despair among the inhabitants of Windsor.
The scene of the morning, and my visit to the dead, which had been spread abroad, had alarmed the country-people, so they had become fit instruments to be played upon by a maniac.
The poor wretch had lost his young wife and lovely infant by the plague.
He was a mechanic; and, rendered unable to attend to the occupation which supplied his necessities, famine was added to his other miseries.
He left the chamber which contained his wife and child--wife and child no more, but "dead earth upon the earth"--wild with hunger, watching and grief, his diseased fancy made him believe himself sent by heaven to preach the end of time to the world.
He entered the churches, and foretold to the congregations their speedy removal to the vaults below.
He appeared like the forgotten spirit of the time in the theatres, and bade the spectators go home and die.
He had been seized and confined; he had escaped and wandered from London among the neighbouring towns, and, with frantic gestures and thrilling words, he unveiled to each their hidden fears, and gave voice to the soundless thought they dared not syllable.
He stood under the arcade of the town-hall of Windsor, and from this elevation harangued a trembling crowd.
"Hear, O ye inhabitants of the earth," he cried, "hear thou, all seeing, but most pitiless Heaven!
hear thou too, O tempest-tossed heart, which breathes out these words, yet faints beneath their meaning!
Death is among us!
The earth is beautiful and flower-bedecked, but she is our grave!
The clouds of heaven weep for us--the pageantry of the stars is but our funeral torchlight.
Grey headed men, ye hoped for yet a few years in your long-known abode--but the lease is up, you must remove--children, ye will never reach maturity, even now the small grave is dug for ye-- mothers, clasp them in your arms, one death embraces you"!
Shuddering, he stretched out his hands, his eyes cast up, seemed bursting from their sockets, while he appeared to follow shapes, to us invisible, in the yielding air--"There they are," he cried, "the dead!
They rise in their shrouds, and pass in silent procession towards the far land of their doom--their bloodless lips move not--their shadowy limbs are void of motion, while still they glide onwards.
We come," he exclaimed, springing forwards, "for what should we wait?
Haste, my friends, apparel yourselves in the court-dress of death.
Pestilence will usher you to his presence.
Why thus long?
they, the good, the wise, and the beloved, are gone before.
Mothers, kiss you last--husbands, protectors no more, lead on the partners of your death!
Come, O come!
while the dear ones are yet in sight, for soon they will pass away, and we never never shall join them more".
From such ravings as these, he would suddenly become collected, and with unexaggerated but terrific words, paint the horrors of the time; describe with minute detail, the effects of the plague on the human frame, and tell heart-breaking tales of the
One man in particular stood in front, his eyes fixt on the prophet, his mouth open, his limbs rigid, while his face changed to various colours, yellow, blue, and green, through intense fear.
The maniac caught his glance, and turned his eye on him-- one has heard of the gaze of the rattle-snake, which allures the trembling victim till he falls within his jaws.
The maniac became composed; his person rose higher; authority beamed from his countenance.
He looked on the peasant, who began to tremble, while he still gazed; his knees knocked together; his teeth chattered.
He at last fell down in convulsions.
"That man has the plague," said the maniac calmly.
A shriek burst from the lips of the poor wretch; and then sudden motionlessness came over him; it was manifest to all that he was dead.
Cries of horror filled the place--every one endeavoured to effect his escape--in a few minutes the market place was cleared--the corpse lay on the ground; and the maniac, subdued and exhausted, sat beside it, leaning his gaunt cheek upon his thin hand.
Soon some people, deputed by the magistrates, came to remove the body; the unfortunate being saw a jailor in each--he fled precipitately, while I passed onwards to the Castle.
Death, cruel and relentless, had entered these beloved walls.
An old servant, who had nursed Idris in infancy, and who lived with us more on the footing of a revered relative than a domestic, had gone a few days before to visit a daughter, married, and settled in the neighbourhood of London.
On the night of her return she sickened of the plague.
From the haughty and unbending nature of the Countess of Windsor, Idris had few tender filial associations with her.
This good woman had stood in the place of a mother, and her very deficiencies of education and knowledge, by rendering her humble and defenceless, endeared her to us--she was the especial favourite of the children.
I found my poor girl, there is no exaggeration in the expression, wild with grief and dread.
She hung over the patient in agony, which was not mitigated when her thoughts wandered towards her babes, for whom she feared infection.
My arrival was like the newly discovered lamp of a lighthouse to sailors, who are weathering some dangerous point.
She deposited her appalling doubts in my hands; she relied on my judgment, and was comforted by my participation in her sorrow.
Soon our poor nurse expired; and the anguish of suspense was changed to deep regret, which though at first more painful, yet yielded with greater readiness to my consolations.
Sleep, the sovereign balm, at length steeped her tearful eyes in forgetfulness.
She slept; and quiet prevailed in the Castle, whose inhabitants were hushed to repose.
I was awake, and during the long hours of dead night, my busy thoughts worked in my brain, like ten thousand mill-wheels, rapid, acute, untameable.
All slept--all England slept; and from my window, commanding a wide prospect of the star-illumined country, I saw the land stretched out in placid rest.
I was awake, alive, while the brother of death possessed my race.
What, if the more potent of these fraternal deities should obtain dominion over it?
The silence of midnight, to speak truly, though apparently a paradox, rung in my ears.
The solitude became intolerable--I placed my hand on the beating heart of Idris, I bent my head to catch the sound of her breath, to assure myself that she still existed--for a moment I doubted whether I should not awake her; so effeminate an horror ran
--Great God!
would it one day be thus?
One day all extinct, save myself, should I walk the earth alone?
Were these warning voices, whose inarticulate and oracular sense forced belief upon me?
Yet I would not call them Voices of warning, that announce to us Only the inevitable.
As the sun, Ere it is risen, sometimes paints its image In the atmosphere--so often do the spirits Of great events stride on before the events, And in to-day already walks to-morrow.

CHAPTER VIII.
AFTER a long interval, I am again impelled by the restless spirit within me to continue my narration; but I must alter the mode which I have hitherto adopted.
The details contained in the foregoing pages, apparently trivial, yet each slightest one weighing like lead in the depressed scale of human afflictions; this tedious dwelling on the sorrows of others, while my own were only in apprehension; this slowly
I had used this history as an opiate; while it described my beloved friends, fresh with life and glowing with hope, active assistants on the scene, I was soothed; there will be a more melancholy pleasure in painting the end of all.
But the intermediate steps, the climbing the wall, raised up between what was and is, while I still looked back nor saw the concealed desert beyond, is a labour past my strength.
Time and experience have placed me on an height from which I can comprehend the past as a whole; and in this way I must describe it, bringing forward the leading incidents, and disposing light and shade so as to form a picture in whose very darkness there
It would be needless to narrate those disastrous occurrences, for which a parallel might be found in any slighter visitation of our gigantic calamity.
Does the reader wish to hear of the pest-houses, where death is the comforter--of the mournful passage of the death-cart--of the insensibility of the worthless, and the anguish of the loving heart--of harrowing shrieks and silence dire--of the variety of
There are many books which can feed the appetite craving for these things; let them turn to the accounts of Boccaccio, De Foe, and Browne.
The vast annihilation that has swallowed all things--the voiceless solitude of the once busy earth--the lonely state of singleness which hems me in, has deprived even such details of their stinging reality, and mellowing the lurid tints of past anguish
I had returned from London possessed by the idea, with the intimate feeling that it was my first duty to secure, as well as I was able, the well-being of my family, and then to return and take my post beside Adrian.
The events that immediately followed on my arrival at Windsor changed this view of things.
The plague was not in London alone, it was every where--it came on us, as Ryland had said, like a thousand packs of wolves, howling through the winter night, gaunt and fierce.
When once disease was introduced into the rural districts, its effects appeared more horrible, more exigent, and more difficult to cure, than in towns.
There was a companionship in suffering there, and, the neighbours keeping constant watch on each other, and inspired by the active benevolence of Adrian, succour was afforded, and the path of destruction smoothed.
But in the country, among the scattered farm-houses, in lone cottages, in fields, and barns, tragedies were acted harrowing to the soul, unseen, unheard, unnoticed.
Medical aid was less easily procured, food was more difficult to obtain, and human beings, unwithheld by shame, for they were unbeheld of their fellows, ventured on deeds of greater wickedness, or gave way more readily to their abject fears.
Deeds of heroism also occurred, whose very mention swells the heart and brings tears into the eyes.
Such is human nature, that beauty and deformity are often closely linked.
In reading history we are chiefly struck by the generosity and self-devotion that follow close on the heels of crime, veiling with supernal flowers the stain of blood.
Such acts were not wanting to adorn the grim train that waited on the progress of the plague.
The inhabitants of Berkshire and Bucks had been long aware that the plague was in London, in Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, York, in short, in all the more populous towns of England.
They were not however the less astonished and dismayed when it appeared among themselves.
They were impatient and angry in the midst of terror.
They would do something to throw off the clinging evil, and, while in action, they fancied that a remedy was applied.
The inhabitants of the smaller towns left their houses, pitched tents in the fields, wandering separate from each other careless of hunger or the sky's inclemency, while they imagined that they avoided the death-dealing disease.
The farmers and cottagers, on the contrary, struck with the fear of solitude, and madly desirous of medical assistance, flocked into the towns.
But winter was coming, and with winter, hope.
In August, the plague had appeared in the country of England, and during September it made its ravages.
Towards the end of October it dwindled away, and was in some degree replaced by a typhus, of hardly less virulence.
The autumn was warm and rainy: the infirm and sickly died off--happier they: many young people flushed with health and prosperity, made pale by wasting malady, became the inhabitants of the grave.
The crop had failed, the bad corn, and want of foreign wines, added vigour to disease.
Before Christmas half England was under water.
The storms of the last winter were renewed; but the diminished shipping of this year caused us to feel less the tempests of the sea.
The flood and storms did more harm to continental Europe than to us--giving, as it were, the last blow to the calamities which destroyed it.
In Italy the rivers were unwatched by the diminished peasantry; and, like wild beasts from their lair when the hunters and dogs are afar, did Tiber, Arno, and Po, rush upon and destroy the fertility of the plains.
Whole villages were carried away.
Rome, and Florence, and Pisa were overflowed, and their marble palaces, late mirrored in tranquil streams, had their foundations shaken by their winter-gifted power.
In Germany and Russia the injury was still more momentous.
But frost would come at last, and with it a renewal of our lease of earth.
Frost would blunt the arrows of pestilence, and enchain the furious elements; and the land would in spring throw off her garment of snow, released from her menace of destruction.
It was not until February that the desired signs of winter appeared.
For three days the snow fell, ice stopped the current of the rivers, and the birds flew out from crackling branches of the frost-whitened trees.
On the fourth morning all vanished.
A south-west wind brought up rain--the sun came out, and mocking the usual laws of nature, seemed even at this early season to burn with solsticial force.
It was no consolation, that with the first winds of March the lanes were filled with violets, the fruit trees covered with blossoms, that the corn sprung up, and the leaves came out, forced by the unseasonable heat.
We feared the balmy air--we feared the cloudless sky, the flower-covered earth, and delightful woods, for we looked on the fabric of the universe no longer as our dwelling, but our tomb, and the fragrant land smelled to the apprehension of fear like a wide
Pisando la tierra dura de continuo el hombre esta y cada passo que da es sobre su sepultura.
[1] Yet notwithstanding these disadvantages winter was breathing time; and we exerted ourselves to make the best of it.
Plague might not revive with the summer; but if it did, it should find us prepared.
It is a part of man's nature to adapt itself through habit even to pain and sorrow.
Pestilence had become a part of our future, our existence; it was to be guarded against, like the flooding of rivers, the encroachments of ocean, or the inclemency of the sky.
After long suffering and bitter experience, some panacea might be discovered; as it was, all that received infection died-- all however were not infected; and it became our part to fix deep the foundations, and raise high the barrier between contagion and
Adrian had introduced systematic modes of proceeding in the metropolis, which, while they were unable to stop the progress of death, yet prevented other evils, vice and folly, from rendering the awful fate of the hour still more tremendous.
I wished to imitate his example, but men are used to --move all together, if they move at all,[2] and I could find no means of leading the inhabitants of scattered towns and villages, who forgot my words as soon as they heard them not, and veered with
I adopted another plan.
Those writers who have imagined a reign of peace and happiness on earth, have generally described a rural country, where each small township was directed by the elders and wise men.
This was the key of my design.
Each village, however small, usually contains a leader, one among themselves whom they venerate, whose advice they seek in difficulty, and whose good opinion they chiefly value.
I was immediately drawn to make this observation by occurrences that presented themselves to my personal experience.
In the village of Little Marlow an old woman ruled the community.
She had lived for some years in an alms-house, and on fine Sundays her threshold was constantly beset by a crowd, seeking her advice and listening to her admonitions.
She had been a soldier's wife, and had seen the world; infirmity, induced by fevers caught in unwholesome quarters, had come on her before its time, and she seldom moved from her little cot.
The plague entered the village; and, while fright and grief deprived the inhabitants of the little wisdom they possessed, old Martha stepped forward and said-- "Before now I have been in a town where there was the plague".
--"And you escaped"?
--"No, but I recovered".
--After this Martha was seated more firmly than ever on the regal seat, elevated by reverence and love.
She entered the cottages of the sick; she relieved their wants with her own hand; she betrayed no fear, and inspired all who saw her with some portion of her own native courage.
She attended the markets--she insisted upon being supplied with food for those who were too poor to purchase it.
She shewed them how the well-being of each included the prosperity of all.
She would not permit the gardens to be neglected, nor the very flowers in the cottage lattices to droop from want of care.
Hope, she said, was better than a doctor's prescription, and every thing that could sustain and enliven the spirits, of more worth than drugs and mixtures.
It was the sight of Little Marlow, and my conversations with Martha, that led me to the plan I formed.
I had before visited the manor houses and gentlemen's seats, and often found the inhabitants actuated by the purest benevolence, ready to lend their utmost aid for the welfare of their tenants.
But this was not enough.
The intimate sympathy generated by similar hopes and fears, similar experience and pursuits, was wanting here.
The poor perceived that the rich possessed other means of preservation than those which could be partaken of by themselves, seclusion, and, as far as circumstances permitted, freedom from care.
They could not place reliance on them, but turned with tenfold dependence to the succour and advice of their equals.
I resolved therefore to go from village to village, seeking out the rustic archon of the place, and by systematizing their exertions, and enlightening their views, encrease both their power and their use among their fellow-cottagers.
Many changes also now occurred in these spontaneous regal elections: depositions and abdications were frequent, while, in the place of the old and prudent, the ardent youth would step forward, eager for action, regardless of danger.
Often too, the voice to which all listened was suddenly silenced, the helping hand cold, the sympathetic eye closed, and the villagers feared still more the death that had selected a choice victim, shivering in dust the heart that had beat for them,
Whoever labours for man must often find ingratitude, watered by vice and folly, spring from the grain which he has sown.
Death, which had in our younger days walked the earth like "a thief that comes in the night," now, rising from his subterranean vault, girt with power, with dark banner floating, came a conqueror.
Many saw, seated above his vice-regal throne, a supreme Providence, who directed his shafts, and guided his progress, and they bowed their heads in resignation, or at least in obedience.
Others perceived only a passing casualty; they endeavoured to exchange terror for heedlessness, and plunged into licentiousness, to avoid the agonizing throes of worst apprehension.
Thus, while the wise, the good, and the prudent were occupied by the labours of benevolence, the truce of winter produced other effects among the young, the thoughtless, and the vicious.
During the colder months there was a general rush to London in search of amusement--the ties of public opinion were loosened; many were rich, heretofore poor--many had lost father and mother, the guardians of their morals, their mentors and restraints.
It would have been useless to have opposed these impulses by barriers, which would only have driven those actuated by them to more pernicious indulgencies.
The theatres were open and thronged; dance and midnight festival were frequented--in many of these decorum was violated, and the evils, which hitherto adhered to an advanced state of civilization, were doubled.
The student left his books, the artist his study: the occupations of life were gone, but the amusements remained; enjoyment might be protracted to the verge of the grave.
All factitious colouring disappeared--death rose like night, and, protected by its murky shadows the blush of modesty, the reserve of pride, the decorum of prudery were frequently thrown aside as useless veils.
This was not universal.
Among better natures, anguish and dread, the fear of eternal separation, and the awful wonder produced by unprecedented calamity, drew closer the ties of kindred and friendship.
Philosophers opposed their principles, as barriers to the inundation of profligacy or despair, and the only ramparts to protect the invaded territory of human life; the religious, hoping now for their reward, clung fast to their creeds, as the rafts and
The loving heart, obliged to contract its view, bestowed its overflow of affection in triple portion on the few that remained.
Yet, even among these, the present, as an unalienable possession, became all of time to which they dared commit the precious freight of their hopes.
The experience of immemorial time had taught us formerly to count our enjoyments by years, and extend our prospect of life through a lengthened period of progression and decay; the long road threaded a vast labyrinth, and the Valley of the Shadow of Death,
But an earthquake had changed the scene--under our very feet the earth yawned--deep and precipitous the gulph below opened to receive us, while the hours charioted us towards the chasm.
But it was winter now, and months must elapse before we are hurled from our security.
We became ephemera, to whom the interval between the rising and setting sun was as a long drawn year of common time.
We should never see our children ripen into maturity, nor behold their downy cheeks roughen, their blithe hearts subdued by passion or care; but we had them now--they lived, and we lived--what more could we desire?
With such schooling did my poor Idris try to hush thronging fears, and in some measure succeeded.
It was not as in summer-time, when each hour might bring the dreaded fate--until summer, we felt sure; and this certainty, short lived as it must be, yet for awhile satisfied her maternal tenderness.
I know not how to express or communicate the sense of concentrated, intense, though evanescent transport, that imparadized us in the present hour.
Our joys were dearer because we saw their end; they were keener because we felt, to its fullest extent, their value; they were purer because their essence was sympathy-- as a meteor is brighter than a star, did the felicity of this winter contain in itself
How lovely is spring!
As we looked from Windsor Terrace on the sixteen fertile counties spread beneath, speckled by happy cottages and wealthier towns, all looked as in former years, heart-cheering and fair.
The land was ploughed, the slender blades of wheat broke through the dark soil, the fruit trees were covered with buds, the husbandman was abroad in the fields, the milk-maid tripped home with well-filled pails, the swallows and martins struck the sunny
[3] Man himself seemed to regenerate, and feel the frost of winter yield to an elastic and warm renewal of life--reason told us that care and sorrow would grow with the opening year--but how to believe the ominous voice breathed up with pestiferous vapours
Where was the plague?
"Here--every where"!
one voice of horror and dismay exclaimed, when in the pleasant days of a sunny May the Destroyer of man brooded again over the earth, forcing the spirit to leave its organic chrysalis, and to enter upon an untried life.
With one mighty sweep of its potent weapon, all caution, all care, all prudence were levelled low: death sat at the tables of the great, stretched itself on the cottager's pallet, seized the dastard who fled, quelled the brave man who resisted: despondency
Sights of woe now became familiar to me, and were I to tell all of anguish and pain that I witnessed, of the despairing moans of age, and the more terrible smiles of infancy in the bosom of horror, my reader, his limbs quivering and his hair on end, would
But the powers of love, poetry, and creative fancy will dwell even beside the sick of the plague, with the squalid, and with the dying.
A feeling of devotion, of duty, of a high and steady purpose, elevated me; a strange joy filled my heart.
In the midst of saddest grief I seemed to tread air, while the spirit of good shed round me an ambrosial atmosphere, which blunted the sting of sympathy, and purified the air of sighs.
If my wearied soul flagged in its career, I thought of my loved home, of the casket that contained my treasures, of the kiss of love and the filial caress, while my eyes were moistened by purest dew, and my heart was at once softened and refreshed by
Maternal affection had not rendered Idris selfish; at the beginning of our calamity she had, with thoughtless enthusiasm, devoted herself to the care of the sick and helpless.
I checked her; and she submitted to my rule.
I told her how the fear of her danger palsied my exertions, how the knowledge of her safety strung my nerves to endurance.
I shewed her the dangers which her children incurred during her absence; and she at length agreed not to go beyond the inclosure of the forest.
Indeed, within the walls of the Castle we had a colony of the unhappy, deserted by their relatives, and in themselves helpless, sufficient to occupy her time and attention, while ceaseless anxiety for my welfare and the health of her children, however she
After watching over and providing for their safety, her second care was to hide from me her anguish and tears.
Each night I returned to the Castle, and found there repose and love awaiting me.
Often I waited beside the bed of death till midnight, and through the obscurity of rainy, cloudy nights rode many miles, sustained by one circumstance only, the safety and sheltered repose of those I loved.
If some scene of tremendous agony shook my frame and fevered my brow, I would lay my head on the lap of Idris, and the tumultuous pulses subsided into a temperate flow --her smile could raise me from hopelessness, her embrace bathe my sorrowing heart in
Summer advanced, and, crowned with the sun's potent rays, plague shot her unerring shafts over the earth.
The nations beneath their influence bowed their heads, and died.
The corn that sprung up in plenty, lay in autumn rotting on the ground, while the melancholy wretch who had gone out to gather bread for his children, lay stiff and plague-struck in the furrow.
The green woods waved their boughs majestically, while the dying were spread beneath their shade, answering the solemn melody with inharmonious cries.
The painted birds flitted through the shades; the careless deer reposed unhurt upon the fern--the oxen and the horses strayed from their unguarded stables, and grazed among the wheat, for death fell on man alone.
With summer and mortality grew our fears.
My poor love and I looked at each other, and our babes.
--"We will save them, Idris," I said, "I will save them.
Years hence we shall recount to them our fears, then passed away with their occasion.
Though they only should remain on the earth, still they shall live, nor shall their cheeks become pale nor their sweet voices languish".
Our eldest in some degree understood the scenes passing around, and at times, he with serious looks questioned me concerning the reason of so vast a desolation.
But he was only ten years old; and the hilarity of youth soon chased unreasonable care from his brow.
Evelyn, a laughing cherub, a gamesome infant, without idea of pain or sorrow, would, shaking back his light curls from his eyes, make the halls re-echo with his merriment, and in a thousand artless ways attract our attention to his play.
Clara, our lovely gentle Clara, was our stay, our solace, our delight.
She made it her task to attend the sick, comfort the sorrowing, assist the aged, and partake the sports and awaken the gaiety of the young.
She flitted through the rooms, like a good spirit, dispatched from the celestial kingdom, to illumine our dark hour with alien splendour.
Gratitude and praise marked where her footsteps had been.
Yet, when she stood in unassuming simplicity before us, playing with our children, or with girlish assiduity performing little kind offices for Idris, one wondered in what fair lineament of her pure loveliness, in what soft tone of her thrilling voice, so
The summer passed tediously, for we trusted that winter would at least check the disease.
That it would vanish altogether was an hope too dear-- too heartfelt, to be expressed.
When such a thought was heedlessly uttered, the hearers, with a gush of tears and passionate sobs, bore witness how deep their fears were, how small their hopes.
For my own part, my exertions for the public good permitted me to observe more closely than most others, the virulence and extensive ravages of our sightless enemy.
A short month has destroyed a village, and where in May the first person sickened, in June the paths were deformed by unburied corpses--the houses tenantless, no smoke arising from the chimneys; and the housewife's clock marked only the hour when death had
From such scenes I have sometimes saved a deserted infant--sometimes led a young and grieving mother from the lifeless image of her first born, or drawn the sturdy labourer from childish weeping over his extinct family.
July is gone.
August must pass, and by the middle of September we may hope.
Each day was eagerly counted; and the inhabitants of towns, desirous to leap this dangerous interval, plunged into dissipation, and strove, by riot, and what they wished to imagine to be pleasure, to banish thought and opiate despair.
None but Adrian could have tamed the motley population of London, which, like a troop of unbitted steeds rushing to their pastures, had thrown aside all minor fears, through the operation of the fear paramount.
Even Adrian was obliged in part to yield, that he might be able, if not to guide, at least to set bounds to the license of the times.
The theatres were kept open; every place of public resort was frequented; though he endeavoured so to modify them, as might best quiet the agitation of the spectators, and at the same time prevent a reaction of misery when the excitement was over.
Tragedies deep and dire were the chief favourites.
Comedy brought with it too great a contrast to the inner despair: when such were attempted, it was not unfrequent for a comedian, in the midst of the laughter occasioned by his disporportioned buffoonery, to find a word or thought in his part that jarred
It was not in my nature to derive consolation from such scenes; from theatres, whose buffoon laughter and discordant mirth awakened distempered sympathy, or where fictitious tears and wailings mocked the heart-felt grief within; from festival or crowded
Once however I witnessed a scene of singular interest at one of the theatres, where nature overpowered art, as an overflowing cataract will tear away the puny manufacture of a mock cascade, which had before been fed by a small portion of its waters.
I had come to London to see Adrian.
He was not at the palace; and, though the attendants did not know whither he had gone, they did not expect him till late at night.
It was between six and seven o'clock, a fine summer afternoon, and I spent my leisure hours in a ramble through the empty streets of London; now turning to avoid an approaching funeral, now urged by curiosity to observe the state of a particular spot; my
I was now in Holborn, and passed by a public house filled with uproarious companions, whose songs, laughter, and shouts were more sorrowful than the pale looks and silence of the mourner.
Such an one was near, hovering round this house.
The sorry plight of her dress displayed her poverty, she was ghastly pale, and continued approaching, first the window and then the door of the house, as if fearful, yet longing to enter.
A sudden burst of song and merriment seemed to sting her to the heart; she murmured, "Can he have the heart"?
and then mustering her courage, she stepped within the threshold.
The landlady met her in the passage; the poor creature asked, "Is my husband here?
Can I see George"?
"See him," cried the woman, "yes, if you go to him; last night he was taken with the plague, and we sent him to the hospital".
The unfortunate inquirer staggered against a wall, a faint cry escaped her --"O!
were you cruel enough," she exclaimed, "to send him there"?
The landlady meanwhile hurried away; but a more compassionate bar-maid gave her a detailed account, the sum of which was, that her husband had been taken ill, after a night of riot, and sent by his boon companions with all expedition to St. Bartholomew's
I had watched this scene, for there was a gentleness about the poor woman that interested me; she now tottered away from the door, walking as well as she could down Holborn Hill; but her strength soon failed her; she leaned against a wall, and her head
I went up to her and offered my services.
She hardly looked up--"You can do me no good," she replied; "I must go to the hospital; if I do not die before I get there".
There were still a few hackney-coaches accustomed to stand about the streets, more truly from habit than for use.
I put her in one of these, and entered with her that I might secure her entrance into the hospital.
Our way was short, and she said little; except interrupted ejaculations of reproach that he had left her, exclamations on the unkindness of some of his friends, and hope that she would find him alive.
There was a simple, natural earnestness about her that interested me in her fate, especially when she assured me that her husband was the best of men,--had been so, till want of business during these unhappy times had thrown him into bad company.
"He could not bear to come home," she said, "only to see our children die.
A man cannot have the patience a mother has, with her own flesh and blood".
We were set down at St. Bartholomew's, and entered the wretched precincts of the house of disease.
The poor creature clung closer to me, as she saw with what heartless haste they bore the dead from the wards, and took them into a room, whose half-opened door displayed a number of corpses, horrible to behold by one unaccustomed to such scenes.
We were directed to the ward where her husband had been first taken, and still was, the nurse said, if alive.
My companion looked eagerly from one bed to the other, till at the end of the ward she espied, on a wretched bed, a squalid, haggard creature, writhing under the torture of disease.
She rushed towards him, she embraced him, blessing God for his preservation.
The enthusiasm that inspired her with this strange joy, blinded her to the horrors about her; but they were intolerably agonizing to me.
The ward was filled with an effluvia that caused my heart to heave with painful qualms.
The dead were carried out, and the sick brought in, with like indifference; some were screaming with pain, others laughing from the influence of more terrible delirium; some were attended by weeping, despairing relations, others called aloud with thrilling
I gave gold to my luckless companion; I recommended her to the care of the attendants; I then hastened away; while the tormentor, the imagination, busied itself in picturing my own loved ones, stretched on such beds, attended thus.
The country afforded no such mass of horrors; solitary wretches died in the open fields; and I have found a survivor in a vacant village, contending at once with famine and disease; but the assembly of pestilence, the banqueting hall of death, was spread
I rambled on, oppressed, distracted by painful emotions--suddenly I found myself before Drury Lane Theatre.
The play was Macbeth--the first actor of the age was there to exert his powers to drug with irreflection the auditors; such a medicine I yearned for, so I entered.
The theatre was tolerably well filled.
Shakspeare, whose popularity was established by the approval of four centuries, had not lost his influence even at this dread period; but was still "Ut magus," the wizard to rule our hearts and govern our imaginations.
I came in during the interval between the third and fourth act.
I looked round on the audience; the females were mostly of the lower classes, but the men were of all ranks, come hither to forget awhile the protracted scenes of wretchedness, which awaited them at their miserable homes.
The curtain drew up, and the stage presented the scene of the witches' cave.
The wildness and supernatural machinery of Macbeth, was a pledge that it could contain little directly connected with our present circumstances.
Great pains had been taken in the scenery to give the semblance of reality to the impossible.
The extreme darkness of the stage, whose only light was received from the fire under the cauldron, joined to a kind of mist that floated about it, rendered the unearthly shapes of the witches obscure and shadowy.
It was not three decrepid old hags that bent over their pot throwing in the grim ingredients of the magic charm, but forms frightful, unreal, and fanciful.
The entrance of Hecate, and the wild music that followed, took us out of this world.
The cavern shape the stage assumed, the beetling rocks, the glare of the fire, the misty shades that crossed the scene at times, the music in harmony with all witch-like fancies, permitted the imagination to revel, without fear of contradiction, or reproof
The entrance of Macbeth did not destroy the illusion, for he was actuated by the same feelings that inspired us, and while the work of magic proceeded we sympathized in his wonder and his daring, and gave ourselves up with our whole souls to the influence
I felt the beneficial result of such excitement, in a renewal of those pleasing flights of fancy to which I had long been a stranger.
The effect of this scene of incantation communicated a portion of its power to that which followed.
We forgot that Malcolm and Macduff were mere human beings, acted upon by such simple passions as warmed our own breasts.
By slow degrees however we were drawn to the real interest of the scene.
A shudder like the swift passing of an electric shock ran through the house, when Rosse exclaimed, in answer to "Stands Scotland where it did"?
Alas, poor country; Almost afraid to know itself!
It cannot Be called our mother, but our grave: where nothing, But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile; Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks that rent the air, Are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems A modern extasy: the dead man's knell Is
Each word struck the sense, as our life's passing bell; we feared to look at each other, but bent our gaze on the stage, as if our eyes could fall innocuous on that alone.
The person who played the part of Rosse, suddenly became aware of the dangerous ground he trod.
He was an inferior actor, but truth now made him excellent; as he went on to announce to Macduff the slaughter of his family, he was afraid to speak, trembling from apprehension of a burst of grief from the audience, not from his fellow-mime.
Each word was drawn out with difficulty; real anguish painted his features; his eyes were now lifted in sudden horror, now fixed in dread upon the ground.
This shew of terror encreased ours, we gasped with him, each neck was stretched out, each face changed with the actor's changes-- at length while Macduff, who, attending to his part, was unobservant of the high wrought sympathy of the house, cried with
Did you say all?
--O hell kite!
All?
What!
all my pretty chickens, and their dam, At one fell swoop!
A pang of tameless grief wrenched every heart, a burst of despair was echoed from every lip.
--I had entered into the universal feeling--I had been absorbed by the terrors of Rosse--I re-echoed the cry of Macduff, and then rushed out as from an hell of torture, to find calm in the free air and silent street.
Free the air was not, or the street silent.
Oh, how I longed then for the dear soothings of maternal Nature, as my wounded heart was still further stung by the roar of heartless merriment from the public-house, by the sight of the drunkard reeling home, having lost the memory of what he would find
I ran on at my utmost speed until I found myself I knew not how, close to Westminster Abbey, and was attracted by the deep and swelling tone of the organ.
I entered with soothing awe the lighted chancel, and listened to the solemn religious chaunt, which spoke peace and hope to the unhappy.
The notes, freighted with man's dearest prayers, re-echoed through the dim aisles, and the bleeding of the soul's wounds was staunched by heavenly balm.
In spite of the misery I deprecated, and could not understand; in spite of the cold hearths of wide London, and the corpse-strewn fields of my native land; in spite of all the variety of agonizing emotions I had that evening experienced, I thought that in
A sentiment approaching happiness followed the total resignation of one's being to the guardianship of the world's ruler.
Alas!
with the failing of this solemn strain, the elevated spirit sank again to earth.
Suddenly one of the choristers died--he was lifted from his desk, the vaults below were hastily opened--he was consigned with a few muttered prayers to the darksome cavern, abode of thousands who had gone before--now wide yawning to receive even all who
In vain I would then have turned from this scene, to darkened aisle or lofty dome, echoing with melodious praise.
In the open air alone I found relief; among nature's beauteous works, her God reassumed his attribute of benevolence, and again I could trust that he who built up the mountains, planted the forests, and poured out the rivers, would erect another state for
Fortunately for me those circumstances were of rare occurrence that obliged me to visit London, and my duties were confined to the rural district which our lofty castle overlooked; and here labour stood in the place of pastime, to occupy such of the
My endeavours were directed towards urging them to their usual attention to their crops, and to the acting as if pestilence did not exist.
The mower's scythe was at times heard; yet the joyless haymakers after they had listlessly turned the grass, forgot to cart it; the shepherd, when he had sheared his sheep, would let the wool lie to be scattered by the winds, deeming it useless to provide
At times however the spirit of life was awakened by these employments; the sun, the refreshing breeze, the sweet smell of the hay, the rustling leaves and prattling rivulets brought repose to the agitated bosom, and bestowed a feeling akin to happiness on
Nor, strange to say, was the time without its pleasures.
Young couples, who had loved long and hopelessly, suddenly found every impediment removed, and wealth pour in from the death of relatives.
The very danger drew them closer.
The immediate peril urged them to seize the immediate opportunity; wildly and passionately they sought to know what delights existence afforded, before they yielded to death, and Snatching their pleasures with rough strife Thorough the iron gates of
One instance of this kind came immediately under our notice, where a high-born girl had in early youth given her heart to one of meaner extraction.
He was a schoolfellow and friend of her brother's, and usually spent a part of the holidays at the mansion of the duke her father.
They had played together as children, been the confidants of each other's little secrets, mutual aids and consolers in difficulty and sorrow.
Love had crept in, noiseless, terrorless at first, till each felt their life bound up in the other, and at the same time knew that they must part.
Their extreme youth, and the purity of their attachment, made them yield with less resistance to the tyranny of circumstances.
The father of the fair Juliet separated them; but not until the young lover had promised to remain absent only till he had rendered himself worthy of her, and she had vowed to preserve her virgin heart, his treasure, till he returned to claim and possess
Plague came, threatening to destroy at once the aim of the ambitious and the hopes of love.
Long the Duke of L----derided the idea that there could be danger while he pursued his plans of cautious seclusion; and he so far succeeded, that it was not till this second summer, that the destroyer, at one fell stroke, overthrew his precautions, his
Poor Juliet saw one by one, father, mother, brothers, and sisters, sicken and die.
Most of the servants fled on the first appearance of disease, those who remained were infected mortally; no neighbour or rustic ventured within the verge of contagion.
By a strange fatality Juliet alone escaped, and she to the last waited on her relatives, and smoothed the pillow of death.
The moment at length came, when the last blow was given to the last of the house: the youthful survivor of her race sat alone among the dead.
There was no living being near to soothe her, or withdraw her from this hideous company.
With the declining heat of a September night, a whirlwind of storm, thunder, and hail, rattled round the house, and with ghastly harmony sung the dirge of her family.
She sat upon the ground absorbed in wordless despair, when through the gusty wind and bickering rain she thought she heard her name called.
Whose could that familiar voice be?
Not one of her relations, for they lay glaring on her with stony eyes.
Again her name was syllabled, and she shuddered as she asked herself, am I becoming mad, or am I dying, that I hear the voices of the departed?
A second thought passed, swift as an arrow, into her brain; she rushed to the window; and a flash of lightning shewed to her the expected vision, her lover in the shrubbery beneath; joy lent her strength to descend the stairs, to open the door, and then
A thousand times she reproached herself, as with a crime, that she should revive to happiness with him.
The natural clinging of the human mind to life and joy was in its full energy in her young heart; she gave herself impetuously up to the enchantment: they were married; and in their radiant features I saw incarnate, for the last time, the spirit of love,
I envied them, but felt how impossible it was to imbibe the same feeling, now that years had multiplied my ties in the world.
Above all, the anxious mother, my own beloved and drooping Idris, claimed my earnest care; I could not reproach the anxiety that never for a moment slept in her heart, but I exerted myself to distract her attention from too keen an observation of the truth
Wretched beings crawled to die under our succouring roof; the inhabitants of the Castle decreased daily, while the survivors huddled together in fear, and, as in a famine-struck boat, the sport of the wild, interminable waves, each looked in the other's
All this I endeavoured to veil, so that it might least impress my Idris; yet, as I have said, my courage survived even despair: I might be vanquished, but I would not yield.
One day, it was the ninth of September, seemed devoted to every disaster, to every harrowing incident.
Early in the day, I heard of the arrival of the aged grandmother of one of our servants at the Castle.
This old woman had reached her hundredth year; her skin was shrivelled, her form was bent and lost in extreme decrepitude; but as still from year to year she continued in existence, out-living many younger and stronger, she began to feel as if she were to
The plague came, and the inhabitants of her village died.
Clinging, with the dastard feeling of the aged, to the remnant of her spent life, she had, on hearing that the pestilence had come into her neighbourhood, barred her door, and closed her casement, refusing to communicate with any.
She would wander out at night to get food, and returned home, pleased that she had met no one, that she was in no danger from the plague.
As the earth became more desolate, her difficulty in acquiring sustenance increased; at first, her son, who lived near, had humoured her by placing articles of food in her way: at last he died.
But, even though threatened by famine, her fear of the plague was paramount; and her greatest care was to avoid her fellow creatures.
She grew weaker each day, and each day she had further to go.
The night before, she had reached Datchet; and, prowling about, had found a baker's shop open and deserted.
Laden with spoil, she hastened to return, and lost her way.
The night was windless, hot, and cloudy; her load became too heavy for her; and one by one she threw away her loaves, still endeavouring to get along, though her hobbling fell into lameness, and her weakness at last into inability to move.
She lay down among the tall corn, and fell asleep.
Deep in midnight, she was awaked by a rustling near her; she would have started up, but her stiff joints refused to obey her will.
A low moan close to her ear followed, and the rustling increased; she heard a smothered voice breathe out, Water, Water!
several times; and then again a sigh heaved from the heart of the sufferer.
The old woman shuddered, she contrived at length to sit upright; but her teeth chattered, and her knees knocked together--close, very close, lay a half-naked figure, just discernible in the gloom, and the cry for water and the stifled moan were again
Her motions at length attracted the attention of her unknown companion; her hand was seized with a convulsive violence that made the grasp feel like iron, the fingers like the keen teeth of a trap.
--"At last you are come"!
were the words given forth--but this exertion was the last effort of the dying--the joints relaxed, the figure fell prostrate, one low moan, the last, marked the moment of death.
Morning broke; and the old woman saw the corpse, marked with the fatal disease, close to her; her wrist was livid with the hold loosened by death.
She felt struck by the plague; her aged frame was unable to bear her away with sufficient speed; and now, believing herself infected, she no longer dreaded the association of others; but, as swiftly as she might, came to her grand-daughter, at Windsor
The sight was horrible; still she clung to life, and lamented her mischance with cries and hideous groans; while the swift advance of the disease shewed, what proved to be the fact, that she could not survive many hours.
While I was directing that the necessary care should be taken of her, Clara came in; she was trembling and pale; and, when I anxiously asked her the cause of her agitation, she threw herself into my arms weeping and exclaiming--"Uncle, dearest uncle, do
I must tell you, for you must know, that Evelyn, poor little Evelyn"--her voice was choked by sobs.
The fear of so mighty a calamity as the loss of our adored infant made the current of my blood pause with chilly horror; but the remembrance of the mother restored my presence of mind.
I sought the little bed of my darling; he was oppressed by fever; but I trusted, I fondly and fearfully trusted, that there were no symptoms of the plague.
He was not three years old, and his illness appeared only one of those attacks incident to infancy.
I watched him long--his heavy half-closed lids, his burning cheeks and restless twining of his small fingers--the fever was violent, the torpor complete--enough, without the greater fear of pestilence, to awaken alarm.
Idris must not see him in this state.
Clara, though only twelve years old, was rendered, through extreme sensibility, so prudent and careful, that I felt secure in entrusting the charge of him to her, and it was my task to prevent Idris from observing their absence.
I administered the fitting remedies, and left my sweet niece to watch beside him, and bring me notice of any change she should observe.
I then went to Idris, contriving in my way, plausible excuses for remaining all day in the Castle, and endeavouring to disperse the traces of care from my brow.
Fortunately she was not alone.
I found Merrival, the astronomer, with her.
He was far too long sighted in his view of humanity to heed the casualties of the day, and lived in the midst of contagion unconscious of its existence.
This poor man, learned as La Place, guileless and unforeseeing as a child, had often been on the point of starvation, he, his pale wife and numerous offspring, while he neither felt hunger, nor observed distress.
His astronomical theories absorbed him; calculations were scrawled with coal on the bare walls of his garret: a hard-earned guinea, or an article of dress, was exchanged for a book without remorse; he neither heard his children cry, nor observed his
His wife was one of those wondrous beings, to be found only among women, with affections not to be diminished by misfortune.
Her mind was divided between boundless admiration for her husband, and tender anxiety for her children--she waited on him, worked for them, and never complained, though care rendered her life one long-drawn, melancholy dream.
He had introduced himself to Adrian, by a request he made to observe some planetary motions from his glass.
His poverty was easily detected and relieved.
He often thanked us for the books we lent him, and for the use of our instruments, but never spoke of his altered abode or change of circumstances.
His wife assured us, that he had not observed any difference, except in the absence of the children from his study, and to her infinite surprise he complained of this unaccustomed quiet.
He came now to announce to us the completion of his Essay on the Pericyclical Motions of the Earth's Axis, and the precession of the equinoctial points.
If an old Roman of the period of the Republic had returned to life, and talked of the impending election of some laurel-crowned consul, or of the last battle with Mithridates, his ideas would not have been more alien to the times, than the conversation of
Man, no longer with an appetite for sympathy, clothed his thoughts in visible signs; nor were there any readers left: while each one, having thrown away his sword with opposing shield alone, awaited the plague, Merrival talked of the state of mankind six
He might with equal interest to us, have added a commentary, to describe the unknown and unimaginable lineaments of the creatures, who would then occupy the vacated dwelling of mankind.
We had not the heart to undeceive the poor old man; and at the moment I came in, he was reading parts of his book to Idris, asking what answer could be given to this or that position.
Idris could not refrain from a smile, as she listened; she had already gathered from him that his family was alive and in health; though not apt to forget the precipice of time on which she stood, yet I could perceive that she was amused for a moment, by
I was glad to see her smile, because it assured me of her total ignorance of her infant's danger: but I shuddered to think of the revulsion that would be occasioned by a discovery of the truth.
While Merrival was talking, Clara softly opened a door behind Idris, and beckoned me to come with a gesture and look of grief.
A mirror betrayed the sign to Idris--she started up.
To suspect evil, to perceive that, Alfred being with us, the danger must regard her youngest darling, to fly across the long chambers into his apartment, was the work but of a moment.
There she beheld her Evelyn lying fever-stricken and motionless.
I followed her, and strove to inspire more hope than I could myself entertain; but she shook her head mournfully.
Anguish deprived her of presence of mind; she gave up to me and Clara the physician's and nurse's parts; she sat by the bed, holding one little burning hand, and, with glazed eyes fixed on her babe, passed the long day in one unvaried agony.
It was not the plague that visited our little boy so roughly; but she could not listen to my assurances; apprehension deprived her of judgment and reflection; every slight convulsion of her child's features shook her frame --if he moved, she dreaded the
The poor little thing's fever encreased towards night.
The sensation is most dreary, to use no stronger term, with which one looks forward to passing the long hours of night beside a sick bed, especially if the patient be an infant, who cannot explain its pain, and whose flickering life resembles the wasting
[5] With eagerness one turns toward the east, with angry impatience one marks the unchequered darkness; the crowing of a cock, that sound of glee during day-time, comes wailing and untuneable--the creaking of rafters, and slight stir of invisible insect is
Clara, overcome by weariness, had seated herself at the foot of her cousin's bed, and in spite of her efforts slumber weighed down her lids; twice or thrice she shook it off; but at length she was conquered and slept.
Idris sat at the bedside, holding Evelyn's hand; we were afraid to speak to each other; I watched the stars --I hung over my child--I felt his little pulse--I drew near the mother--again I receded.
At the turn of morning a gentle sigh from the patient attracted me, the burning spot on his cheek faded--his pulse beat softly and regularly--torpor yielded to sleep.
For a long time I dared not hope; but when his unobstructed breathing and the moisture that suffused his forehead, were tokens no longer to be mistaken of the departure of mortal malady, I ventured to whisper the news of the change to Idris, and at length
But neither this assurance, nor the speedy convalescence of our child could restore her, even to the portion of peace she before enjoyed.
Her fear had been too deep, too absorbing, too entire, to be changed to security.
She felt as if during her past calm she had dreamed, but was now awake; she was As one In some lone watch-tower on the deep, awakened From soothing visions of the home he loves, Trembling to hear the wrathful billows roar;[6] as one who has been cradled by
Before, she had been visited by pangs of fear--now, she never enjoyed an interval of hope.
No smile of the heart ever irradiated her fair countenance; sometimes she forced one, and then gushing tears would flow, and the sea of grief close above these wrecks of past happiness.
Still while I was near her, she could not be in utter despair-- she fully confided herself to me--she did not seem to fear my death, or revert to its possibility; to my guardianship she consigned the full freight of her anxieties, reposing on my love, as a
While I, not proudly as in days of joy, yet tenderly, and with glad consciousness of the comfort I afforded, drew my trembling girl close to my heart, and tried to ward every painful thought or rough circumstance from her sensitive nature.
One other incident occurred at the end of this summer.
The Countess of Windsor, Ex-Queen of England, returned from Germany.
She had at the beginning of the season quitted the vacant city of Vienna; and, unable to tame her haughty mind to anything like submission, she had delayed at Hamburgh, and, when at last she came to London, many weeks elapsed before she gave Adrian notice
In spite of her coldness and long absence, he welcomed her with sensibility, displaying such affection as sought to heal the wounds of pride and sorrow, and was repulsed only by her total apparent want of sympathy.
Idris heard of her mother's return with pleasure.
Her own maternal feelings were so ardent, that she imagined her parent must now, in this waste world, have lost pride and harshness, and would receive with delight her filial attentions.
The first check to her duteous demonstrations was a formal intimation from the fallen majesty of England, that I was in no manner to be intruded upon her.
She consented, she said, to forgive her daughter, and acknowledge her grandchildren; larger concessions must not be expected.
To me this proceeding appeared (if so light a term may be permitted) extremely whimsical.
Now that the race of man had lost in fact all distinction of rank, this pride was doubly fatuitous; now that we felt a kindred, fraternal nature with all who bore the stamp of humanity, this angry reminiscence of times for ever gone, was worse than
Idris was too much taken up by her own dreadful fears, to be angry, hardly grieved; for she judged that insensibility must be the source of this continued rancour.
This was not altogether the fact: but predominant self-will assumed the arms and masque of callous feeling; and the haughty lady disdained to exhibit any token of the struggle she endured; while the slave of pride, she fancied that she sacrificed her
False was all this--false all but the affections of our nature, and the links of sympathy with pleasure or pain.
There was but one good and one evil in the world--life and death.
The pomp of rank, the assumption of power, the possessions of wealth vanished like morning mist.
One living beggar had become of more worth than a national peerage of dead lords-- alas the day!
--than of dead heroes, patriots, or men of genius.
There was much of degradation in this: for even vice and virtue had lost their attributes--life--life--the continuation of our animal mechanism-- was the Alpha and Omega of the desires, the prayers, the prostrate ambition of human race.

CHAPTER IX.
HALF England was desolate, when October came, and the equinoctial winds swept over the earth, chilling the ardours of the unhealthy season.
The summer, which was uncommonly hot, had been protracted into the beginning of this month, when on the eighteenth a sudden change was brought about from summer temperature to winter frost.
Pestilence then made a pause in her death-dealing career.
Gasping, not daring to name our hopes, yet full even to the brim with intense expectation, we stood, as a ship-wrecked sailor stands on a barren rock islanded by the ocean, watching a distant vessel, fancying that now it nears, and then again that it is
This promise of a renewed lease of life turned rugged natures to melting tenderness, and by contrast filled the soft with harsh and unnatural sentiments.
When it seemed destined that all were to die, we were reckless of the how and when--now that the virulence of the disease was mitigated, and it appeared willing to spare some, each was eager to be among the elect, and clung to life with dastard tenacity.
Instances of desertion became more frequent; and even murders, which made the hearer sick with horror, where the fear of contagion had armed those nearest in blood against each other.
But these smaller and separate tragedies were about to yield to a mightier interest--and, while we were promised calm from infectious influences, a tempest arose wilder than the winds, a tempest bred by the passions of man, nourished by his most violent
A number of people from North America, the relics of that populous continent, had set sail for the East with mad desire of change, leaving their native plains for lands not less afflicted than their own.
Several hundreds landed in Ireland, about the first of November, and took possession of such vacant habitations as they could find; seizing upon the superabundant food, and the stray cattle.
As they exhausted the produce of one spot, they went on to another.
At length they began to interfere with the inhabitants, and strong in their concentrated numbers, ejected the natives from their dwellings, and robbed them of their winter store.
A few events of this kind roused the fiery nature of the Irish; and they attacked the invaders.
Some were destroyed; the major part escaped by quick and well ordered movements; and danger made them careful.
Their numbers ably arranged; the very deaths among them concealed; moving on in good order, and apparently given up to enjoyment, they excited the envy of the Irish.
The Americans permitted a few to join their band, and presently the recruits outnumbered the strangers--nor did they join with them, nor imitate the admirable order which, preserved by the Trans-Atlantic chiefs, rendered them at once secure and formidable.
The Irish followed their track in disorganized multitudes; each day encreasing; each day becoming more lawless.
The Americans were eager to escape from the spirit they had roused, and, reaching the eastern shores of the island, embarked for England.
Their incursion would hardly have been felt had they come alone; but the Irish, collected in unnatural numbers, began to feel the inroads of famine, and they followed in the wake of the Americans for England also.
The crossing of the sea could not arrest their progress.
The harbours of the desolate sea-ports of the west of Ireland were filled with vessels of all sizes, from the man of war to the small fishers' boat, which lay sailorless, and rotting on the lazy deep.
The emigrants embarked by hundreds, and unfurling their sails with rude hands, made strange havoc of buoy and cordage.
Those who modestly betook themselves to the smaller craft, for the most part achieved their watery journey in safety.
Some, in the true spirit of reckless enterprise, went on board a ship of an hundred and twenty guns; the vast hull drifted with the tide out of the bay, and after many hours its crew of landsmen contrived to spread a great part of her enormous canvass--the
The port-holes were open, and with every sea, which as she lurched, washed her decks, they received whole tons of water.
The difficulties were increased by a fresh breeze which began to blow, whistling among the shrowds, dashing the sails this way and that, and rending them with horrid split, and such whir as may have visited the dreams of Milton, when he imagined the
These sounds were mingled with the roaring of the sea, the splash of the chafed billows round the vessel's sides, and the gurgling up of the water in the hold.
The crew, many of whom had never seen the sea before, felt indeed as if heaven and earth came ruining together, as the vessel dipped her bows in the waves, or rose high upon them.
Their yells were drowned in the clamour of elements, and the thunder rivings of their unwieldy habitation--they discovered at last that the water gained on them, and they betook themselves to their pumps; they might as well have laboured to empty the ocean
As the sun went down, the gale encreased; the ship seemed to feel her danger, she was now completely water-logged, and presented other indications of settling before she went down.
The bay was crowded with vessels, whose crews, for the most part, were observing the uncouth sportings of this huge unwieldy machine--they saw her gradually sink; the waters now rising above her lower decks--they could hardly wink before she had utterly
Some few of her crew were saved, but the greater part clinging to her cordage and masts went down with her, to rise only when death loosened their hold.
This event caused many of those who were about to sail, to put foot again on firm land, ready to encounter any evil rather than to rush into the yawning jaws of the pitiless ocean.
But these were few, in comparison to the numbers who actually crossed.
Many went up as high as Belfast to ensure a shorter passage, and then journeying south through Scotland, they were joined by the poorer natives of that country, and all poured with one consent into England.
Such incursions struck the English with affright, in all those towns where there was still sufficient population to feel the change.
There was room enough indeed in our hapless country for twice the number of invaders; but their lawless spirit instigated them to violence; they took a delight in thrusting the possessors from their houses; in seizing on some mansion of luxury, where the
When unopposed they spread their ravages wide; in cases of danger they clustered, and by dint of numbers overthrew their weak and despairing foes.
They came from the east and the north, and directed their course without apparent motive, but unanimously towards our unhappy metropolis.
Communication had been to a great degree cut off through the paralyzing effects of pestilence, so that the van of our invaders had proceeded as far as Manchester and Derby, before we received notice of their arrival.
They swept the country like a conquering army, burning--laying waste-- murdering.
The lower and vagabond English joined with them.
Some few of the Lords Lieutenant who remained, endeavoured to collect the militia--but the ranks were vacant, panic seized on all, and the opposition that was made only served to increase the audacity and cruelty of the enemy.
They talked of taking London, conquering England--calling to mind the long detail of injuries which had for many years been forgotten.
Such vaunts displayed their weakness, rather than their strength--yet still they might do extreme mischief, which, ending in their destruction, would render them at last objects of compassion and remorse.
We were now taught how, in the beginning of the world, mankind clothed their enemies in impossible attributes--and how details proceeding from mouth to mouth, might, like Virgil's ever-growing Rumour, reach the heavens with her brow, and clasp Hesperus and
Gorgon and Centaur, dragon and iron-hoofed lion, vast sea-monster and gigantic hydra, were but types of the strange and appalling accounts brought to London concerning our invaders.
Their landing was long unknown, but having now advanced within an hundred miles of London, the country people flying before them arrived in successive troops, each exaggerating the numbers, fury, and cruelty of the assailants.
Tumult filled the before quiet streets--women and children deserted their homes, escaping they knew not whither--fathers, husbands, and sons, stood trembling, not for themselves, but for their loved and defenceless relations.
As the country people poured into London, the citizens fled southwards--they climbed the higher edifices of the town, fancying that they could discern the smoke and flames the enemy spread around them.
As Windsor lay, to a great degree, in the line of march from the west, I removed my family to London, assigning the Tower for their sojourn, and joining Adrian, acted as his Lieutenant in the coming struggle.
We employed only two days in our preparations, and made good use of them.
Artillery and arms were collected; the remnants of such regiments, as could be brought through many losses into any show of muster, were put under arms, with that appearance of military discipline which might encourage our own party, and seem most
Even music was not wanting: banners floated in the air, and the shrill fife and loud trumpet breathed forth sounds of encouragement and victory.
A practised ear might trace an undue faltering in the step of the soldiers; but this was not occasioned so much by fear of the adversary, as by disease, by sorrow, and by fatal prognostications, which often weighed most potently on the brave, and quelled
Adrian led the troops.
He was full of care.
It was small relief to him that our discipline should gain us success in such a conflict; while plague still hovered to equalize the conqueror and the conquered, it was not victory that he desired, but bloodless peace.
As we advanced, we were met by bands of peasantry, whose almost naked condition, whose despair and horror, told at once the fierce nature of the coming enemy.
The senseless spirit of conquest and thirst of spoil blinded them, while with insane fury they deluged the country in ruin.
The sight of the military restored hope to those who fled, and revenge took place of fear.
They inspired the soldiers with the same sentiment.
Languor was changed to ardour, the slow step converted to a speedy pace, while the hollow murmur of the multitude, inspired by one feeling, and that deadly, filled the air, drowning the clang of arms and sound of music.
Adrian perceived the change, and feared that it would be difficult to prevent them from wreaking their utmost fury on the Irish.
He rode through the lines, charging the officers to restrain the troops, exhorting the soldiers, restoring order, and quieting in some degree the violent agitation that swelled every bosom.
We first came upon a few stragglers of the Irish at St. Albans.
They retreated, and, joining others of their companions, still fell back, till they reached the main body.
Tidings of an armed and regular opposition recalled them to a sort of order.
They made Buckingham their head-quarters, and scouts were sent out to ascertain our situation.
We remained for the night at Luton.
In the morning a simultaneous movement caused us each to advance.
It was early dawn, and the air, impregnated with freshest odour, seemed in idle mockery to play with our banners, and bore onwards towards the enemy the music of the bands, the neighings of the horses, and regular step of the infantry.
The first sound of martial instruments that came upon our undisciplined foe, inspired surprise, not unmingled with dread.
It spoke of other days, of days of concord and order; it was associated with times when plague was not, and man lived beyond the shadow of imminent fate.
The pause was momentary.
Soon we heard their disorderly clamour, the barbarian shouts, the untimed step of thousands coming on in disarray.
Their troops now came pouring on us from the open country or narrow lanes; a large extent of unenclosed fields lay between us; we advanced to the middle of this, and then made a halt: being somewhat on superior ground, we could discern the space they
When their leaders perceived us drawn out in opposition, they also gave the word to halt, and endeavoured to form their men into some imitation of military discipline.
The first ranks had muskets; some were mounted, but their arms were such as they had seized during their advance, their horses those they had taken from the peasantry; there was no uniformity, and little obedience, but their shouts and wild gestures showed
Our soldiers received the word, and advanced to quickest time, but in perfect order: their uniform dresses, the gleam of their polished arms, their silence, and looks of sullen hate, were more appalling than the savage clamour of our innumerous foe.
Thus coming nearer and nearer each other, the howls and shouts of the Irish increased; the English proceeded in obedience to their officers, until they came near enough to distinguish the faces of their enemies; the sight inspired them with fury: with one
I was beside Adrian; a moment before he had again given the word to halt, and had remained a few yards distant from us in deep meditation: he was forming swiftly his plan of action, to prevent the effusion of blood; the noise of cannon, the sudden rush of
and plunging the rowels into his horse's sides, he dashed between the conflicting bands.
We, his staff, followed him to surround and protect him; obeying his signal, however, we fell back somewhat.
The soldiery perceiving him, paused in their onset; he did not swerve from the bullets that passed near him, but rode immediately between the opposing lines.
Silence succeeded to clamour; about fifty men lay on the ground dying or dead.
Adrian raised his sword in act to speak: "By whose command," he cried, addressing his own troops, "do you advance?
Who ordered your attack?
Fall back; these misguided men shall not be slaughtered, while I am your general.
Sheath your weapons; these are your brothers, commit not fratricide; soon the plague will not leave one for you to glut your revenge upon: will you be more pitiless than pestilence?
As you honour me--as you worship God, in whose image those also are created--as your children and friends are dear to you,--shed not a drop of precious human blood".
He spoke with outstretched hand and winning voice, and then turning to our invaders, with a severe brow, he commanded them to lay down their arms: "Do you think," he said, "that because we are wasted by plague, you can overcome us; the plague is also among
Lay down your arms, barbarous and cruel men--men whose hands are stained with the blood of the innocent, whose souls are weighed down by the orphan's cry!
We shall conquer, for the right is on our side; already your cheeks are pale--the weapons fall from your nerveless grasp.
Lay down your arms, fellow men!
brethren!
Pardon, succour, and brotherly love await your repentance.
You are dear to us, because you wear the frail shape of humanity; each one among you will find a friend and host among these forces.
Shall man be the enemy of man, while plague, the foe to all, even now is above us, triumphing in our butchery, more cruel than her own"?
Each army paused.
On our side the soldiers grasped their arms firmly, and looked with stern glances on the foe.
These had not thrown down their weapons, more from fear than the spirit of contest; they looked at each other, each wishing to follow some example given him,--but they had no leader.
Adrian threw himself from his horse, and approaching one of those just slain: "He was a man," he cried, "and he is dead.
O quickly bind up the wounds of the fallen--let not one die; let not one more soul escape through your merciless gashes, to relate before the throne of God the tale of fratricide; bind up their wounds--restore them to their friends.
Cast away the hearts of tigers that burn in your breasts; throw down those tools of cruelty and hate; in this pause of exterminating destiny, let each man be brother, guardian, and stay to the other.
Away with those blood-stained arms, and hasten some of you to bind up these wounds".
As he spoke, he knelt on the ground, and raised in his arms a man from whose side the warm tide of life gushed--the poor wretch gasped--so still had either host become, that his moans were distinctly heard, and every heart, late fiercely bent on universal
Adrian tore off his military scarf and bound it round the sufferer--it was too late--the man heaved a deep sigh, his head fell back, his limbs lost their sustaining power.
-- "He is dead"!
said Adrian, as the corpse fell from his arms on the ground, and he bowed his head in sorrow and awe.
The fate of the world seemed bound up in the death of this single man.
On either side the bands threw down their arms, even the veterans wept, and our party held out their hands to their foes, while a gush of love and deepest amity filled every heart.
The two forces mingling, unarmed and hand in hand, talking only how each might assist the other, the adversaries conjoined; each repenting, the one side their former cruelties, the other their late violence, they obeyed the orders of the General to proceed
Adrian was obliged to exert his utmost prudence, first to allay the discord, and then to provide for the multitude of the invaders.
They were marched to various parts of the southern counties, quartered in deserted villages,--a part were sent back to their own island, while the season of winter so far revived our energy, that the passes of the country were defended, and any increase of
On this occasion Adrian and Idris met after a separation of nearly a year.
Adrian had been occupied in fulfilling a laborious and painful task.
He had been familiar with every species of human misery, and had for ever found his powers inadequate, his aid of small avail.
Yet the purpose of his soul, his energy and ardent resolution, prevented any re-action of sorrow.
He seemed born anew, and virtue, more potent than Medean alchemy, endued him with health and strength.
Idris hardly recognized the fragile being, whose form had seemed to bend even to the summer breeze, in the energetic man, whose very excess of sensibility rendered him more capable of fulfilling his station of pilot in storm-tossed England.
It was not thus with Idris.
She was uncomplaining; but the very soul of fear had taken its seat in her heart.
She had grown thin and pale, her eyes filled with involuntary tears, her voice was broken and low.
She tried to throw a veil over the change which she knew her brother must observe in her, but the effort was ineffectual; and when alone with him, with a burst of irrepressible grief she gave vent to her apprehensions and sorrow.
She described in vivid terms the ceaseless care that with still renewing hunger ate into her soul; she compared this gnawing of sleepless expectation of evil, to the vulture that fed on the heart of Prometheus; under the influence of this eternal
Sleep was not sleep, for her waking thoughts, bridled by some remains of reason, and by the sight of her children happy and in health, were then transformed to wild dreams, all her terrors were realized, all her fears received their dread fulfilment.
To this state there was no hope, no alleviation, unless the grave should quickly receive its destined prey, and she be permitted to die, before she experienced a thousand living deaths in the loss of those she loved.
Fearing to give me pain, she hid as best she could the excess of her wretchedness, but meeting thus her brother after a long absence, she could not restrain the expression of her woe, but with all the vividness of imagination with which misery is always
Her present visit to London tended to augment her state of inquietude, by shewing in its utmost extent the ravages occasioned by pestilence.
It hardly preserved the appearance of an inhabited city; grass sprung up thick in the streets; the squares were weed-grown, the houses were shut up, while silence and loneliness characterized the busiest parts of the town.
Yet in the midst of desolation Adrian had preserved order; and each one continued to live according to law and custom--human institutions thus surviving as it were divine ones, and while the decree of population was abrogated, property continued sacred.
It was a melancholy reflection; and in spite of the diminution of evil produced, it struck on the heart as a wretched mockery.
All idea of resort for pleasure, of theatres and festivals had passed away.
"Next summer," said Adrian as we parted on our return to Windsor, "will decide the fate of the human race.
I shall not pause in my exertions until that time; but, if plague revives with the coming year, all contest with her must cease, and our only occupation be the choice of a grave".
I must not forget one incident that occurred during this visit to London.
The visits of Merrival to Windsor, before frequent, had suddenly ceased.
At this time where but a hair's line separated the living from the dead, I feared that our friend had become a victim to the all-embracing evil.
On this occasion I went, dreading the worst, to his dwelling, to see if I could be of any service to those of his family who might have survived.
The house was deserted, and had been one of those assigned to the invading strangers quartered in London.
I saw his astronomical instruments put to strange uses, his globes defaced, his papers covered with abstruse calculations destroyed.
The neighbours could tell me little, till I lighted on a poor woman who acted as nurse in these perilous times.
She told me that all the family were dead, except Merrival himself, who had gone mad-- mad, she called it, yet on questioning her further, it appeared that he was possessed only by the delirium of excessive grief.
This old man, tottering on the edge of the grave, and prolonging his prospect through millions of calculated years,--this visionary who had not seen starvation in the wasted forms of his wife and children, or plague in the horrible sights and sounds that
Through long habit they had become a part of himself; his want of worldly knowledge, his absence of mind and infant guilelessness, made him utterly dependent on them.
It was not till one of them died that he perceived their danger; one by one they were carried off by pestilence; and his wife, his helpmate and supporter, more necessary to him than his own limbs and frame, which had hardly been taught the lesson of
The old man felt the system of universal nature which he had so long studied and adored, slide from under him, and he stood among the dead, and lifted his voice in curses.
--No wonder that the attendant should interpret as phrensy the harrowing maledictions of the grief-struck old man.
I had commenced my search late in the day, a November day, that closed in early with pattering rain and melancholy wind.
As I turned from the door, I saw Merrival, or rather the shadow of Merrival, attenuated and wild, pass me, and sit on the steps of his home.
The breeze scattered the grey locks on his temples, the rain drenched his uncovered head, he sat hiding his face in his withered hands.
I pressed his shoulder to awaken his attention, but he did not alter his position.
"Merrival," I said, "it is long since we have seen you--you must return to Windsor with me--Lady Idris desires to see you, you will not refuse her request--come home with me".
He replied in a hollow voice, "Why deceive a helpless old man, why talk hypocritically to one half crazed?
Windsor is not my home; my true home I have found; the home that the Creator has prepared for me".
His accent of bitter scorn thrilled me--"Do not tempt me to speak," he continued, "my words would scare you--in an universe of cowards I dare think--among the church-yard tombs--among the victims of His merciless tyranny I dare reproach the Supreme Evil.
How can he punish me?
Let him bare his arm and transfix me with lightning--this is also one of his attributes"--and the old man laughed.
He rose, and I followed him through the rain to a neighbouring church-yard --he threw himself on the wet earth.
"Here they are," he cried, "beautiful creatures--breathing, speaking, loving creatures.
She who by day and night cherished the age-worn lover of her youth--they, parts of my flesh, my children--here they are: call them, scream their names through the night; they will not answer"!
He clung to the little heaps that marked the graves.
"I ask but one thing; I do not fear His hell, for I have it here; I do not desire His heaven, let me but die and be laid beside them; let me but, when I lie dead, feel my flesh as it moulders, mingle with theirs.
Promise," and he raised himself painfully, and seized my arm, "promise to bury me with them".
"So God help me and mine as I promise," I replied, "on one condition: return with me to Windsor".
"To Windsor"!
he cried with a shriek, "Never!
--from this place I never go --my bones, my flesh, I myself, are already buried here, and what you see of me is corrupted clay like them.
I will lie here, and cling here, till rain, and hail, and lightning and storm, ruining on me, make me one in substance with them below".
In a few words I must conclude this tragedy.
I was obliged to leave London, and Adrian undertook to watch over him; the task was soon fulfilled; age, grief, and inclement weather, all united to hush his sorrows, and bring repose to his heart, whose beats were agony.
He died embracing the sod, which was piled above his breast, when he was placed beside the beings whom he regretted with such wild despair.
I returned to Windsor at the wish of Idris, who seemed to think that there was greater safety for her children at that spot; and because, once having taken on me the guardianship of the district, I would not desert it while an inhabitant survived.
I went also to act in conformity with Adrian's plans, which was to congregate in masses what remained of the population; for he possessed the conviction that it was only through the benevolent and social virtues that any safety was to be hoped for the
It was a melancholy thing to return to this spot so dear to us, as the scene of a happiness rarely before enjoyed, here to mark the extinction of our species, and trace the deep uneraseable footsteps of disease over the fertile and cherished soil.
The aspect of the country had so far changed, that it had been impossible to enter on the task of sowing seed, and other autumnal labours.
That season was now gone; and winter had set in with sudden and unusual severity.
Alternate frosts and thaws succeeding to floods, rendered the country impassable.
Heavy falls of snow gave an arctic appearance to the scenery; the roofs of the houses peeped from the white mass; the lowly cot and stately mansion, alike deserted, were blocked up, their thresholds uncleared; the windows were broken by the hail, while the
The altered state of society made these accidents of nature, sources of real misery.
The luxury of command and the attentions of servitude were lost.
It is true that the necessaries of life were assembled in such quantities, as to supply to superfluity the wants of the diminished population; but still much labour was required to arrange these, as it were, raw materials; and depressed by sickness, and
I can speak for myself--want of energy was not my failing.
The intense life that quickened my pulses, and animated my frame, had the effect, not of drawing me into the mazes of active life, but of exalting my lowliness, and of bestowing majestic proportions on insignificant objects--I could have lived the life of
The very spirit of the Greek mythology inhabited my heart; I deified the uplands, glades, and streams, I Had sight of Proteus coming from the sea; And heard old Triton blow his wreathed horn.
[1] Strange, that while the earth preserved her monotonous course, I dwelt with ever-renewing wonder on her antique laws, and now that with excentric wheel she rushed into an untried path, I should feel this spirit fade; I struggled with despondency and
Perhaps, after the labours and stupendous excitement of the past summer, the calm of winter and the almost menial toils it brought with it, were by natural re-action doubly irksome.
It was not the grasping passion of the preceding year, which gave life and individuality to each moment--it was not the aching pangs induced by the distresses of the times.
The utter inutility that had attended all my exertions took from them their usual effects of exhilaration, and despair rendered abortive the balm of self applause--I longed to return to my old occupations, but of what use were they?
To read were futile--to write, vanity indeed.
The earth, late wide circus for the display of dignified exploits, vast theatre for a magnificent drama, now presented a vacant space, an empty stage--for actor or spectator there was no longer aught to say or hear.
Our little town of Windsor, in which the survivors from the neighbouring counties were chiefly assembled, wore a melancholy aspect.
Its streets were blocked up with snow--the few passengers seemed palsied, and frozen by the ungenial visitation of winter.
To escape these evils was the aim and scope of all our exertions.
Families late devoted to exalting and refined pursuits, rich, blooming, and young, with diminished numbers and care-fraught hearts, huddled over a fire, grown selfish and grovelling through suffering.
Without the aid of servants, it was necessary to discharge all household duties; hands unused to such labour must knead the bread, or in the absence of flour, the statesmen or perfumed courtier must undertake the butcher's office.
Poor and rich were now equal, or rather the poor were the superior, since they entered on such tasks with alacrity and experience; while ignorance, inaptitude, and habits of repose, rendered them fatiguing to the luxurious, galling to the proud, disgustful
But in every change goodness and affection can find field for exertion and display.
Among some these changes produced a devotion and sacrifice of self at once graceful and heroic.
It was a sight for the lovers of the human race to enjoy; to behold, as in ancient times, the patriarchal modes in which the variety of kindred and friendship fulfilled their duteous and kindly offices.
Youths, nobles of the land, performed for the sake of mother or sister, the services of menials with amiable cheerfulness.
They went to the river to break the ice, and draw water: they assembled on foraging expeditions, or axe in hand felled the trees for fuel.
The females received them on their return with the simple and affectionate welcome known before only to the lowly cottage--a clean hearth and bright fire; the supper ready cooked by beloved hands; gratitude for the provision for to-morrow's meal: strange
None was more conspicuous for this graceful submission to circumstances, noble humility, and ingenious fancy to adorn such acts with romantic colouring, than our own Clara.
She saw my despondency, and the aching cares of Idris.
Her perpetual study was to relieve us from labour and to spread ease and even elegance over our altered mode of life.
We still had some attendants spared by disease, and warmly attached to us.
But Clara was jealous of their services; she would be sole handmaid of Idris, sole minister to the wants of her little cousins; nothing gave her so much pleasure as our employing her in this way; she went beyond our desires, earnest, diligent, and
[2] It was my task each day to visit the various families assembled in our town, and when the weather permitted, I was glad to prolong my ride, and to muse in solitude over every changeful appearance of our destiny, endeavouring to gather lessons for the
The impatience with which, while in society, the ills that afflicted my species inspired me, were softened by loneliness, when individual suffering was merged in the general calamity, strange to say, less afflicting to contemplate.
Thus often, pushing my way with difficulty through the narrow snow-blocked town, I crossed the bridge and passed through Eton.
No youthful congregation of gallant-hearted boys thronged the portal of the college; sad silence pervaded the busy school-room and noisy playground.
I extended my ride towards Salt Hill, on every side impeded by the snow.
Were those the fertile fields I loved--was that the interchange of gentle upland and cultivated dale, once covered with waving corn, diversified by stately trees, watered by the meandering Thames?
One sheet of white covered it, while bitter recollection told me that cold as the winter-clothed earth, were the hearts of the inhabitants.
I met troops of horses, herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, wandering at will; here throwing down a hay-rick, and nestling from cold in its heart, which afforded them shelter and food--there having taken possession of a vacant cottage.
Once on a frosty day, pushed on by restless unsatisfying reflections, I sought a favourite haunt, a little wood not far distant from Salt Hill.
A bubbling spring prattles over stones on one side, and a plantation of a few elms and beeches, hardly deserve, and yet continue the name of wood.
This spot had for me peculiar charms.
It had been a favourite resort of Adrian; it was secluded; and he often said that in boyhood, his happiest hours were spent here; having escaped the stately bondage of his mother, he sat on the rough hewn steps that led to the spring, now reading a
A melancholy foreboding assured me that I should never see this place more; so with careful thought, I noted each tree, every winding of the streamlet and irregularity of the soil, that I might better call up its idea in absence.
A robin red-breast dropt from the frosty branches of the trees, upon the congealed rivulet; its panting breast and half-closed eyes shewed that it was dying: a hawk appeared in the air; sudden fear seized the little creature; it exerted its last strength,
I took it up and placed it in my breast.
I fed it with a few crumbs from a biscuit; by degrees it revived; its warm fluttering heart beat against me; I cannot tell why I detail this trifling incident--but the scene is still before me; the snow-clad fields seen through the silvered trunks of the
--why string my nerves and renew my wearied efforts--ah, why?
But that my firm courage and cheerful exertions might shelter the dear mate, whom I chose in the spring of my life; though the throbbings of my heart be replete with pain, though my hopes for the future are chill, still while your dear head, my gentlest
One fine February day, when the sun had reassumed some of its genial power, I walked in the forest with my family.
It was one of those lovely winter-days which assert the capacity of nature to bestow beauty on barrenness.
The leafless trees spread their fibrous branches against the pure sky; their intricate and pervious tracery resembled delicate sea-weed; the deer were turning up the snow in search of the hidden grass; the white was made intensely dazzling by the sun, and
Our children, freed from the bondage of winter, bounded before us; pursuing the deer, or rousing the pheasants and partridges from their coverts.
Idris leant on my arm; her sadness yielded to the present sense of pleasure.
We met other families on the Long Walk, enjoying like ourselves the return of the genial season.
At once, I seemed to awake; I cast off the clinging sloth of the past months; earth assumed a new appearance, and my view of the future was suddenly made clear.
I exclaimed, "I have now found out the secret"!
"What secret"?
In answer to this question, I described our gloomy winter-life, our sordid cares, our menial labours:--"This northern country," I said, "is no place for our diminished race.
When mankind were few, it was not here that they battled with the powerful agents of nature, and were enabled to cover the globe with offspring.
We must seek some natural Paradise, some garden of the earth, where our simple wants may be easily supplied, and the enjoyment of a delicious climate compensate for the social pleasures we have lost.
If we survive this coming summer, I will not spend the ensuing winter in England; neither I nor any of us".
I spoke without much heed, and the very conclusion of what I said brought with it other thoughts.
Should we, any of us, survive the coming summer?
I saw the brow of Idris clouded; I again felt, that we were enchained to the car of fate, over whose coursers we had no control.
We could no longer say, This we will do, and this we will leave undone.
A mightier power than the human was at hand to destroy our plans or to achieve the work we avoided.
It were madness to calculate upon another winter.
This was our last.
The coming summer was the extreme end of our vista; and, when we arrived there, instead of a continuation of the long road, a gulph yawned, into which we must of force be precipitated.
The last blessing of humanity was wrested from us; we might no longer hope.
Can the madman, as he clanks his chains, hope?
Can the wretch, led to the scaffold, who when he lays his head on the block, marks the double shadow of himself and the executioner, whose uplifted arm bears the axe, hope?
Can the ship-wrecked mariner, who spent with swimming, hears close behind the splashing waters divided by a shark which pursues him through the Atlantic, hope?
Such hope as theirs, we also may entertain!
Old fable tells us, that this gentle spirit sprung from the box of Pandora, else crammed with evils; but these were unseen and null, while all admired the inspiriting loveliness of young Hope; each man's heart became her home; she was enthroned sovereign
But like all other gifts of the Creator to Man, she is mortal; her life has attained its last hour.
We have watched over her; nursed her flickering existence; now she has fallen at once from youth to decrepitude, from health to immedicinable disease; even as we spend ourselves in struggles for her recovery, she dies; to all nations the voice goes forth,
We are but mourners in the funeral train, and what immortal essence or perishable creation will refuse to make one in the sad procession that attends to its grave the dead comforter of humanity?
Does not the sun call in his light?
and day Like a thin exhalation melt away-- Both wrapping up their beams in clouds to be Themselves close mourners at this obsequie.

CHAPTER I. HEAR YOU not the rushing sound of the coming tempest?
Do you not behold the clouds open, and destruction lurid and dire pour down on the blasted earth?
See you not the thunderbolt fall, and are deafened by the shout of heaven that follows its descent?
Feel you not the earth quake and open with agonizing groans, while the air is pregnant with shrieks and wailings,-- all announcing the last days of man?
No!
none of these things accompanied our fall!
The balmy air of spring, breathed from nature's ambrosial home, invested the lovely earth, which wakened as a young mother about to lead forth in pride her beauteous offspring to meet their sire who had been long absent.
The buds decked the trees, the flowers adorned the land: the dark branches, swollen with seasonable juices, expanded into leaves, and the variegated foliage of spring, bending and singing in the breeze, rejoiced in the genial warmth of the unclouded
Where was pain and evil?
Not in the calm air or weltering ocean; not in the woods or fertile fields, nor among the birds that made the woods resonant with song, nor the animals that in the midst of plenty basked in the sunshine.
Our enemy, like the Calamity of Homer, trod our hearts, and no sound was echoed from her steps-- With ills the land is rife, with ills the sea, Diseases haunt our frail humanity, Through noon, through night, on casual wing they glide, Silent,--a voice the
[1] Once man was a favourite of the Creator, as the royal psalmist sang, "God had made him a little lower than the angels, and had crowned him with glory and honour.
God made him to have dominion over the works of his hands, and put all things under his feet".
Once it was so; now is man lord of the creation?
Look at him--ha!
I see plague!
She has invested his form, is incarnate in his flesh, has entwined herself with his being, and blinds his heaven-seeking eyes.
Lie down, O man, on the flower-strown earth; give up all claim to your inheritance, all you can ever possess of it is the small cell which the dead require.
Plague is the companion of spring, of sunshine, and plenty.
We no longer struggle with her.
We have forgotten what we did when she was not.
Of old navies used to stem the giant ocean-waves betwixt Indus and the Pole for slight articles of luxury.
Men made perilous journies to possess themselves of earth's splendid trifles, gems and gold.
Human labour was wasted--human life set at nought.
Now life is all that we covet; that this automaton of flesh should, with joints and springs in order, perform its functions, that this dwelling of the soul should be capable of containing its dweller.
Our minds, late spread abroad through countless spheres and endless combinations of thought, now retrenched themselves behind this wall of flesh, eager to preserve its well-being only.
We were surely sufficiently degraded.
At first the increase of sickness in spring brought increase of toil to such of us, who, as yet spared to life, bestowed our time and thoughts on our fellow creatures.
We nerved ourselves to the task: "in the midst of despair we performed the tasks of hope".
We went out with the resolution of disputing with our foe.
We aided the sick, and comforted the sorrowing; turning from the multitudinous dead to the rare survivors, with an energy of desire that bore the resemblance of power, we bade them--live.
Plague sat paramount the while, and laughed us to scorn.
Have any of you, my readers, observed the ruins of an anthill immediately after its destruction?
At first it appears entirely deserted of its former inhabitants; in a little time you see an ant struggling through the upturned mould; they reappear by twos and threes, running hither and thither in search of their lost companions.
Such were we upon earth, wondering aghast at the effects of pestilence.
Our empty habitations remained, but the dwellers were gathered to the shades of the tomb.
As the rules of order and pressure of laws were lost, some began with hesitation and wonder to transgress the accustomed uses of society.
Palaces were deserted, and the poor man dared at length, unreproved, intrude into the splendid apartments, whose very furniture and decorations were an unknown world to him.
It was found, that, though at first the stop put to all circulation of property, had reduced those before supported by the factitious wants of society to sudden and hideous poverty, yet when the boundaries of private possession were thrown down, the
To some among the poor this was matter of exultation.
We were all equal now; magnificent dwellings, luxurious carpets, and beds of down, were afforded to all.
Carriages and horses, gardens, pictures, statues, and princely libraries, there were enough of these even to superfluity; and there was nothing to prevent each from assuming possession of his share.
We were all equal now; but near at hand was an equality still more levelling, a state where beauty and strength, and wisdom, would be as vain as riches and birth.
The grave yawned beneath us all, and its prospect prevented any of us from enjoying the ease and plenty which in so awful a manner was presented to us.
Still the bloom did not fade on the cheeks of my babes; and Clara sprung up in years and growth, unsullied by disease.
We had no reason to think the site of Windsor Castle peculiarly healthy, for many other families had expired beneath its roof; we lived therefore without any particular precaution; but we lived, it seemed, in safety.
If Idris became thin and pale, it was anxiety that occasioned the change; an anxiety I could in no way alleviate.
She never complained, but sleep and appetite fled from her, a slow fever preyed on her veins, her colour was hectic, and she often wept in secret; gloomy prognostications, care, and agonizing dread, ate up the principle of life within her.
I could not fail to perceive this change.
I often wished that I had permitted her to take her own course, and engage herself in such labours for the welfare of others as might have distracted her thoughts.
But it was too late now.
Besides that, with the nearly extinct race of man, all our toils grew near a conclusion, she was too weak; consumption, if so it might be called, or rather the over active life within her, which, as with Adrian, spent the vital oil in the early morning
At night, when she could leave me unperceived, she wandered through the house, or hung over the couches of her children; and in the day time would sink into a perturbed sleep, while her murmurs and starts betrayed the unquiet dreams that vexed her.
As this state of wretchedness became more confirmed, and, in spite of her endeavours at concealment more apparent, I strove, though vainly, to awaken in her courage and hope.
I could not wonder at the vehemence of her care; her very soul was tenderness; she trusted indeed that she should not outlive me if I became the prey of the vast calamity, and this thought sometimes relieved her.
We had for many years trod the highway of life hand in hand, and still thus linked, we might step within the shades of death; but her children, her lovely, playful, animated children--beings sprung from her own dear side--portions of her own
But it would not be so; young and blooming as they were, they would die, and from the hopes of maturity, from the proud name of attained manhood, they were cut off for ever.
Often with maternal affection she had figured their merits and talents exerted on life's wide stage.
Alas for these latter days!
The world had grown old, and all its inmates partook of the decrepitude.
Why talk of infancy, manhood, and old age?
We all stood equal sharers of the last throes of time-worn nature.
Arrived at the same point of the world's age--there was no difference in us; the name of parent and child had lost their meaning; young boys and girls were level now with men.
This was all true; but it was not less agonizing to take the admonition home.
Where could we turn, and not find a desolation pregnant with the dire lesson of example?
The fields had been left uncultivated, weeds and gaudy flowers sprung up,--or where a few wheat-fields shewed signs of the living hopes of the husbandman, the work had been left halfway, the ploughman had died beside the plough; the horses had deserted the
Sickly and few, the country people neither went out to sow nor reap; but sauntered about the meadows, or lay under the hedges, when the inclement sky did not drive them to take shelter under the nearest roof.
Many of those who remained, secluded themselves; some had laid up stores which should prevent the necessity of leaving their homes;--some deserted wife and child, and imagined that they secured their safety in utter solitude.
Such had been Ryland's plan, and he was discovered dead and half-devoured by insects, in a house many miles from any other, with piles of food laid up in useless superfluity.
Others made long journies to unite themselves to those they loved, and arrived to find them dead.
London did not contain above a thousand inhabitants; and this number was continually diminishing.
Most of them were country people, come up for the sake of change; the Londoners had sought the country.
The busy eastern part of the town was silent, or at most you saw only where, half from cupidity, half from curiosity, the warehouses had been more ransacked than pillaged: bales of rich India goods, shawls of price, jewels, and spices, unpacked, strewed
In some places the possessor had to the last kept watch on his store, and died before the barred gates.
The massy portals of the churches swung creaking on their hinges; and some few lay dead on the pavement.
The wretched female, loveless victim of vulgar brutality, had wandered to the toilet of high-born beauty, and, arraying herself in the garb of splendour, had died before the mirror which reflected to herself alone her altered appearance.
Women whose delicate feet had seldom touched the earth in their luxury, had fled in fright and horror from their homes, till, losing themselves in the squalid streets of the metropolis, they had died on the threshold of poverty.
The heart sickened at the variety of misery presented; and, when I saw a specimen of this gloomy change, my soul ached with the fear of what might befall my beloved Idris and my babes.
Were they, surviving Adrian and myself, to find themselves protectorless in the world?
As yet the mind alone had suffered--could I for ever put off the time, when the delicate frame and shrinking nerves of my child of prosperity, the nursling of rank and wealth, who was my companion, should be invaded by famine, hardship, and disease?
Better die at once--better plunge a poinard in her bosom, still untouched by drear adversity, and then again sheathe it in my own!
But, no; in times of misery we must fight against our destinies, and strive not to be overcome by them.
I would not yield, but to the last gasp resolutely defended my dear ones against sorrow and pain; and if I were vanquished at last, it should not be ingloriously.
I stood in the gap, resisting the enemy--the impalpable, invisible foe, who had so long besieged us--as yet he had made no breach: it must be my care that he should not, secretly undermining, burst up within the very threshold of the temple of love, at
The hunger of Death was now stung more sharply by the diminution of his food: or was it that before, the survivors being many, the dead were less eagerly counted?
Now each life was a gem, each human breathing form of far, O!
far more worth than subtlest imagery of sculptured stone; and the daily, nay, hourly decrease visible in our numbers, visited the heart with sickening misery.
This summer extinguished our hopes, the vessel of society was wrecked, and the shattered raft, which carried the few survivors over the sea of misery, was riven and tempest tost.
Man existed by twos and threes; man, the individual who might sleep, and wake, and perform the animal functions; but man, in himself weak, yet more powerful in congregated numbers than wind or ocean; man, the queller of the elements, the lord of created
Farewell to the patriotic scene, to the love of liberty and well earned meed of virtuous aspiration!
--farewell to crowded senate, vocal with the councils of the wise, whose laws were keener than the sword blade tempered at Damascus!
--farewell to kingly pomp and warlike pageantry; the crowns are in the dust, and the wearers are in their graves!
--farewell to the desire of rule, and the hope of victory; to high vaulting ambition, to the appetite for praise, and the craving for the suffrage of their fellows!
The nations are no longer!
No senate sits in council for the dead; no scion of a time honoured dynasty pants to rule over the inhabitants of a charnel house; the general's hand is cold, and the soldier has his untimely grave dug in his native fields, unhonoured, though in youth.
The market-place is empty, the candidate for popular favour finds none whom he can represent.
To chambers of painted state farewell!
--To midnight revelry, and the panting emulation of beauty, to costly dress and birth-day shew, to title and the gilded coronet, farewell!
Farewell to the giant powers of man,--to knowledge that could pilot the deep-drawing bark through the opposing waters of shoreless ocean,--to science that directed the silken balloon through the pathless air,--to the power that could put a barrier to
Farewell to the arts,--to eloquence, which is to the human mind as the winds to the sea, stirring, and then allaying it;--farewell to poetry and deep philosophy, for man's imagination is cold, and his enquiring mind can no longer expatiate on the wonders
--to the graceful building, which in its perfect proportion transcended the rude forms of nature, the fretted gothic and massy saracenic pile, to the stupendous arch and glorious dome, the fluted column with its capital, Corinthian, Ionic, or Doric, the
--farewell to sculpture, where the pure marble mocks human flesh, and in the plastic expression of the culled excellencies of the human shape, shines forth the god!
--farewell to painting, the high wrought sentiment and deep knowledge of the artists's mind in pictured canvas--to paradisaical scenes, where trees are ever vernal, and the ambrosial air rests in perpetual glow:--to the stamped form of tempest, and wildest
Farewell to music, and the sound of song; to the marriage of instruments, where the concord of soft and harsh unites in sweet harmony, and gives wings to the panting listeners, whereby to climb heaven, and learn the hidden pleasures of the eternals!
--Farewell to the well-trod stage; a truer tragedy is enacted on the world's ample scene, that puts to shame mimic grief: to high-bred comedy, and the low buffoon, farewell!
--Man may laugh no more.
Alas!
to enumerate the adornments of humanity, shews, by what we have lost, how supremely great man was.
It is all over now.
He is solitary; like our first parents expelled from Paradise, he looks back towards the scene he has quitted.
The high walls of the tomb, and the flaming sword of plague, lie between it and him.
Like to our first parents, the whole earth is before him, a wide desart.
Unsupported and weak, let him wander through fields where the unreaped corn stands in barren plenty, through copses planted by his fathers, through towns built for his use.
Posterity is no more; fame, and ambition, and love, are words void of meaning; even as the cattle that grazes in the field, do thou, O deserted one, lie down at evening-tide, unknowing of the past, careless of the future, for from such fond ignorance alone
Joy paints with its own colours every act and thought.
The happy do not feel poverty--for delight is as a gold-tissued robe, and crowns them with priceless gems.
Enjoyment plays the cook to their homely fare, and mingles intoxication with their simple drink.
Joy strews the hard couch with roses, and makes labour ease.
Sorrow doubles the burthen to the bent-down back; plants thorns in the unyielding pillow; mingles gall with water; adds saltness to their bitter bread; cloathing them in rags, and strewing ashes on their bare heads.
To our irremediable distress every small and pelting inconvenience came with added force; we had strung our frames to endure the Atlean weight thrown on us; we sank beneath the added feather chance threw on us, "the grasshopper was a burthen".
Many of the survivors had been bred in luxury--their servants were gone, their powers of command vanished like unreal shadows: the poor even suffered various privations; and the idea of another winter like the last, brought affright to our minds.
Was it not enough that we must die, but toil must be added?
--must we prepare our funeral repast with labour, and with unseemly drudgery heap fuel on our deserted hearths --must we with servile hands fabricate the garments, soon to be our shroud?
Not so!
We are presently to die, let us then enjoy to its full relish the remnant of our lives.
Sordid care, avaunt!
menial labours, and pains, slight in themselves, but too gigantic for our exhausted strength, shall make no part of our ephemeral existences.
In the beginning of time, when, as now, man lived by families, and not by tribes or nations, they were placed in a genial clime, where earth fed them untilled, and the balmy air enwrapt their reposing limbs with warmth more pleasant than beds of down.
The south is the native place of the human race; the land of fruits, more grateful to man than the hard-earned Ceres of the north,--of trees, whose boughs are as a palace-roof, of couches of roses, and of the thirst-appeasing grape.
We need not there fear cold and hunger.
Look at England!
the grass shoots up high in the meadows; but they are dank and cold, unfit bed for us.
Corn we have none, and the crude fruits cannot support us.
We must seek firing in the bowels of the earth, or the unkind atmosphere will fill us with rheums and aches.
The labour of hundreds of thousands alone could make this inclement nook fit habitation for one man.
To the south then, to the sun!
--where nature is kind, where Jove has showered forth the contents of Amalthea's horn, and earth is garden.
England, late birth-place of excellence and school of the wise, thy children are gone, thy glory faded!
Thou, England, wert the triumph of man!
Small favour was shewn thee by thy Creator, thou Isle of the North; a ragged canvas naturally, painted by man with alien colours; but the hues he gave are faded, never more to be renewed.
So we must leave thee, thou marvel of the world; we must bid farewell to thy clouds, and cold, and scarcity for ever!
Thy manly hearts are still; thy tale of power and liberty at its close!
Bereft of man, O little isle!
the ocean waves will buffet thee, and the raven flap his wings over thee; thy soil will be birth-place of weeds, thy sky will canopy barrenness.
It was not for the rose of Persia thou wert famous, nor the banana of the east; not for the spicy gales of India, nor the sugar groves of America; not for thy vines nor thy double harvests, nor for thy vernal airs, nor solstitial sun--but for thy children,
They are gone, and thou goest with them the oft trodden path that leads to oblivion, -- Farewell, sad Isle, farewell, thy fatal glory Is summed, cast up, and cancelled in this story.

CHAPTER II.
IN the autumn of this year 2096, the spirit of emigration crept in among the few survivors, who, congregating from various parts of England, met in London.
This spirit existed as a breath, a wish, a far off thought, until communicated to Adrian, who imbibed it with ardour, and instantly engaged himself in plans for its execution.
The fear of immediate death vanished with the heats of September.
Another winter was before us, and we might elect our mode of passing it to the best advantage.
Perhaps in rational philosophy none could be better chosen than this scheme of migration, which would draw us from the immediate scene of our woe, and, leading us through pleasant and picturesque countries, amuse for a time our despair.
The idea once broached, all were impatient to put it in execution.
We were still at Windsor; our renewed hopes medicined the anguish we had suffered from the late tragedies.
The death of many of our inmates had weaned us from the fond idea, that Windsor Castle was a spot sacred from the plague; but our lease of life was renewed for some months, and even Idris lifted her head, as a lily after a storm, when a last sunbeam tinges
Just at this time Adrian came down to us; his eager looks shewed us that he was full of some scheme.
He hastened to take me aside, and disclosed to me with rapidity his plan of emigration from England.
To leave England for ever!
to turn from its polluted fields and groves, and, placing the sea between us, to quit it, as a sailor quits the rock on which he has been wrecked, when the saving ship rides by.
Such was his plan.
To leave the country of our fathers, made holy by their graves!
--We could not feel even as a voluntary exile of old, who might for pleasure or convenience forsake his native soil; though thousands of miles might divide him, England was still a part of him, as he of her.
He heard of the passing events of the day; he knew that, if he returned, and resumed his place in society, the entrance was still open, and it required but the will, to surround himself at once with the associations and habits of boyhood.
Not so with us, the remnant.
We left none to represent us, none to repeople the desart land, and the name of England died, when we left her, In vagabond pursuit of dreadful safety.
Yet let us go!
England is in her shroud,--we may not enchain ourselves to a corpse.
Let us go--the world is our country now, and we will choose for our residence its most fertile spot.
Shall we, in these desart halls, under this wintry sky, sit with closed eyes and folded hands, expecting death?
Let us rather go out to meet it gallantly: or perhaps--for all this pendulous orb, this fair gem in the sky's diadem, is not surely plague-striken--perhaps, in some secluded nook, amidst eternal spring, and waving trees, and purling streams, we may find
The world is vast, and England, though her many fields and wide spread woods seem interminable, is but a small part of her.
At the close of a day's march over high mountains and through snowy vallies, we may come upon health, and committing our loved ones to its charge, replant the uprooted tree of humanity, and send to late posterity the tale of the ante-pestilential race, the
Hope beckons and sorrow urges us, the heart beats high with expectation, and this eager desire of change must be an omen of success.
O come!
Farewell to the dead!
farewell to the tombs of those we loved!
--farewell to giant London and the placid Thames, to river and mountain or fair district, birth-place of the wise and good, to Windsor Forest and its antique castle, farewell!
themes for story alone are they,--we must live elsewhere.
Such were in part the arguments of Adrian, uttered with enthusiasm and unanswerable rapidity.
Something more was in his heart, to which he dared not give words.
He felt that the end of time was come; he knew that one by one we should dwindle into nothingness.
It was not adviseable to wait this sad consummation in our native country; but travelling would give us our object for each day, that would distract our thoughts from the swift-approaching end of things.
If we went to Italy, to sacred and eternal Rome, we might with greater patience submit to the decree, which had laid her mighty towers low.
We might lose our selfish grief in the sublime aspect of its desolation.
All this was in the mind of Adrian; but he thought of my children, and, instead of communicating to me these resources of despair, he called up the image of health and life to be found, where we knew not--when we knew not; but if never to be found, for
He won me over to his party, heart and soul.
It devolved on me to disclose our plan to Idris.
The images of health and hope which I presented to her, made her with a smile consent.
With a smile she agreed to leave her country, from which she had never before been absent, and the spot she had inhabited from infancy; the forest and its mighty trees, the woodland paths and green recesses, where she had played in childhood, and had lived
They were her life; dearer than a spot consecrated to love, dearer than all else the earth contained.
The boys heard with childish glee of our removal: Clara asked if we were to go to Athens.
"It is possible," I replied; and her countenance became radiant with pleasure.
There she would behold the tomb of her parents, and the territory filled with recollections of her father's glory.
In silence, but without respite, she had brooded over these scenes.
It was the recollection of them that had turned her infant gaiety to seriousness, and had impressed her with high and restless thoughts.
There were many dear friends whom we must not leave behind, humble though they were.
There was the spirited and obedient steed which Lord Raymond had given his daughter; there was Alfred's dog and a pet eagle, whose sight was dimmed through age.
But this catalogue of favourites to be taken with us, could not be made without grief to think of our heavy losses, and a deep sigh for the many things we must leave behind.
The tears rushed into the eyes of Idris, while Alfred and Evelyn brought now a favourite rose tree, now a marble vase beautifully carved, insisting that these must go, and exclaiming on the pity that we could not take the castle and the forest, the deer
"Fond and foolish ones," I said, "we have lost for ever treasures far more precious than these; and we desert them, to preserve treasures to which in comparison they are nothing.
Let us not for a moment forget our object and our hope; and they will form a resistless mound to stop the overflowing of our regret for trifles".
The children were easily distracted, and again returned to their prospect of future amusement.
Idris had disappeared.
She had gone to hide her weakness; escaping from the castle, she had descended to the little park, and sought solitude, that she might there indulge her tears; I found her clinging round an old oak, pressing its rough trunk with her roseate lips, as her
I drew her towards me; and, as she felt my kisses on her eyelids, as she felt my arms press her, she revived to the knowledge of what remained to her.
"You are very kind not to reproach me," she said: "I weep, and a bitter pang of intolerable sorrow tears my heart.
And yet I am happy; mothers lament their children, wives lose their husbands, while you and my children are left to me.
Yes, I am happy, most happy, that I can weep thus for imaginary sorrows, and that the slight loss of my adored country is not dwindled and annihilated in mightier misery.
Take me where you will; where you and my children are, there shall be Windsor, and every country will be England to me.
Let these tears flow not for myself, happy and ungrateful as I am, but for the dead world--for our lost country--for all of love, and life, and joy, now choked in the dusty chambers of death".
She spoke quickly, as if to convince herself; she turned her eyes from the trees and forest-paths she loved; she hid her face in my bosom, and we-- yes, my masculine firmness dissolved--we wept together consolatory tears, and then calm--nay, almost
The first cold weather of an English October, made us hasten our preparations.
I persuaded Idris to go up to London, where she might better attend to necessary arrangements.
I did not tell her, that to spare her the pang of parting from inanimate objects, now the only things left, I had resolved that we should none of us return to Windsor.
For the last time we looked on the wide extent of country visible from the terrace, and saw the last rays of the sun tinge the dark masses of wood variegated by autumnal tints; the uncultivated fields and smokeless cottages lay in shadow below; the Thames
Nature was the same, as when she was the kind mother of the human race; now, childless and forlorn, her fertility was a mockery; her loveliness a mask for deformity.
Why should the breeze gently stir the trees, man felt not its refreshment?
Why did dark night adorn herself with stars--man saw them not?
Why are there fruits, or flowers, or streams, man is not here to enjoy them?
Idris stood beside me, her dear hand locked in mine.
Her face was radiant with a smile.
--"The sun is alone," she said, "but we are not.
A strange star, my Lionel, ruled our birth; sadly and with dismay we may look upon the annihilation of man; but we remain for each other.
Did I ever in the wide world seek other than thee?
And since in the wide world thou remainest, why should I complain?
Thou and nature are still true to me.
Beneath the shades of night, and through the day, whose garish light displays our solitude, thou wilt still be at my side, and even Windsor will not be regretted".
I had chosen night time for our journey to London, that the change and desolation of the country might be the less observable.
Our only surviving servant drove us.
We past down the steep hill, and entered the dusky avenue of the Long Walk.
At times like these, minute circumstances assume giant and majestic proportions; the very swinging open of the white gate that admitted us into the forest, arrested my thoughts as matter of interest; it was an every day act, never to occur again!
The setting crescent of the moon glittered through the massy trees to our right, and when we entered the park, we scared a troop of deer, that fled bounding away in the forest shades.
Our two boys quietly slept; once, before our road turned from the view, I looked back on the castle.
Its windows glistened in the moonshine, and its heavy outline lay in a dark mass against the sky--the trees near us waved a solemn dirge to the midnight breeze.
Idris leaned back in the carriage; her two hands pressed mine, her countenance was placid, she seemed to lose the sense of what she now left, in the memory of what she still possessed.
My thoughts were sad and solemn, yet not of unmingled pain.
The very excess of our misery carried a relief with it, giving sublimity and elevation to sorrow.
I felt that I carried with me those I best loved; I was pleased, after a long separation to rejoin Adrian; never again to part.
I felt that I quitted what I loved, not what loved me.
The castle walls, and long familiar trees, did not hear the parting sound of our carriage-wheels with regret.
And, while I felt Idris to be near, and heard the regular breathing of my children, I could not be unhappy.
Clara was greatly moved; with streaming eyes, suppressing her sobs, she leaned from the window, watching the last glimpse of her native Windsor.
Adrian welcomed us on our arrival.
He was all animation; you could no longer trace in his look of health, the suffering valetudinarian; from his smile and sprightly tones you could not guess that he was about to lead forth from their native country, the numbered remnant of the English
Adrian was impatient for our departure, and had advanced far in his preparations.
His wisdom guided all.
His care was the soul, to move the luckless crowd, who relied wholly on him.
It was useless to provide many things, for we should find abundant provision in every town.
It was Adrian's wish to prevent all labour; to bestow a festive appearance on this funeral train.
Our numbers amounted to not quite two thousand persons.
These were not all assembled in London, but each day witnessed the arrival of fresh numbers, and those who resided in the neighbouring towns, had received orders to assemble at one place, on the twentieth of November.
Carriages and horses were provided for all; captains and under officers chosen, and the whole assemblage wisely organized.
All obeyed the Lord Protector of dying England; all looked up to him.
His council was chosen, it consisted of about fifty persons.
Distinction and station were not the qualifications of their election.
We had no station among us, but that which benevolence and prudence gave; no distinction save between the living and the dead.
Although we were anxious to leave England before the depth of winter, yet we were detained.
Small parties had been dispatched to various parts of England, in search of stragglers; we would not go, until we had assured ourselves that in all human probability we did not leave behind a single human being.
On our arrival in London, we found that the aged Countess of Windsor was residing with her son in the palace of the Protectorate; we repaired to our accustomed abode near Hyde Park.
Idris now for the first time for many years saw her mother, anxious to assure herself that the childishness of old age did not mingle with unforgotten pride, to make this high-born dame still so inveterate against me.
Age and care had furrowed her cheeks, and bent her form; but her eye was still bright, her manners authoritative and unchanged; she received her daughter coldly, but displayed more feeling as she folded her grand-children in her arms.
It is our nature to wish to continue our systems and thoughts to posterity through our own offspring.
The Countess had failed in this design with regard to her children; perhaps she hoped to find the next remove in birth more tractable.
Once Idris named me casually--a frown, a convulsive gesture of anger, shook her mother, and, with voice trembling with hate, she said--"I am of little worth in this world; the young are impatient to push the old off the scene; but, Idris, if you do not
This was a strange speech, now that, on the empty stage, each might play his part without impediment from the other.
But the haughty Ex-Queen thought as Octavius Caesar and Mark Antony, We could not stall together In the whole world.
The period of our departure was fixed for the twenty-fifth of November.
The weather was temperate; soft rains fell at night, and by day the wintry sun shone out.
Our numbers were to move forward in separate parties, and to go by different routes, all to unite at last at Paris.
Adrian and his division, consisting in all of five hundred persons, were to take the direction of Dover and Calais.
On the twentieth of November, Adrian and I rode for the last time through the streets of London.
They were grass-grown and desert.
The open doors of the empty mansions creaked upon their hinges; rank herbage, and deforming dirt, had swiftly accumulated on the steps of the houses; the voiceless steeples of the churches pierced the smokeless air; the churches were open, but no prayer
We passed St. Paul's.
London, which had extended so far in suburbs in all direction, had been somewhat deserted in the midst, and much of what had in former days obscured this vast building was removed.
Its ponderous mass, blackened stone, and high dome, made it look, not like a temple, but a tomb.
Methought above the portico was engraved the Hic jacet of England.
We passed on eastwards, engaged in such solemn talk as the times inspired.
No human step was heard, nor human form discerned.
Troops of dogs, deserted of their masters, passed us; and now and then a horse, unbridled and unsaddled, trotted towards us, and tried to attract the attention of those which we rode, as if to allure them to seek like liberty.
An unwieldy ox, who had fed in an abandoned granary, suddenly lowed, and shewed his shapeless form in a narrow door-way; every thing was desert; but nothing was in ruin.
And this medley of undamaged buildings, and luxurious accommodation, in trim and fresh youth, was contrasted with the lonely silence of the unpeopled streets.
Night closed in, and it began to rain.
We were about to return homewards, when a voice, a human voice, strange now to hear, attracted our attention.
It was a child singing a merry, lightsome air; there was no other sound.
We had traversed London from Hyde Park even to where we now were in the Minories, and had met no person, heard no voice nor footstep.
The singing was interrupted by laughing and talking; never was merry ditty so sadly timed, never laughter more akin to tears.
The door of the house from which these sounds proceeded was open, the upper rooms were illuminated as for a feast.
It was a large magnificent house, in which doubtless some rich merchant had lived.
The singing again commenced, and rang through the high-roofed rooms, while we silently ascended the stair-case.
Lights now appeared to guide us; and a long suite of splendid rooms illuminated, made us still more wonder.
Their only inhabitant, a little girl, was dancing, waltzing, and singing about them, followed by a large Newfoundland dog, who boisterously jumping on her, and interrupting her, made her now scold, now laugh, now throw herself on the carpet to play with
She was dressed grotesquely, in glittering robes and shawls fit for a woman; she appeared about ten years of age.
We stood at the door looking on this strange scene, till the dog perceiving us barked loudly; the child turned and saw us: her face, losing its gaiety, assumed a sullen expression: she slunk back, apparently meditating an escape.
I came up to her, and held her hand; she did not resist, but with a stern brow, so strange in childhood, so different from her former hilarity, she stood still, her eyes fixed on the ground.
"What do you do here"?
I said gently; "Who are you"?
--she was silent, but trembled violently.
--"My poor child," asked Adrian, "are you alone"?
There was a winning softness in his voice, that went to the heart of the little girl; she looked at him, then snatching her hand from me, threw herself into his arms, clinging round his neck, ejaculating--"Save me!
save me"!
while her unnatural sullenness dissolved in tears.
"I will save you," he replied, "of what are you afraid?
you need not fear my friend, he will do you no harm.
Are you alone"?
"No, Lion is with me".
"And your father and mother?
--" "I never had any; I am a charity girl.
Every body is gone, gone for a great, great many days; but if they come back and find me out, they will beat me so"!
Her unhappy story was told in these few words: an orphan, taken on pretended charity, ill-treated and reviled, her oppressors had died: unknowing of what had passed around her, she found herself alone; she had not dared venture out, but by the continuance
She readily consented to go with Adrian.
In the mean time, while we descanted on alien sorrows, and on a solitude which struck our eyes and not our hearts, while we imagined all of change and suffering that had intervened in these once thronged streets, before, tenantless and abandoned, they
Day by day, during that time, the health of my Idris declined: her heart was broken; neither sleep nor appetite, the chosen servants of health, waited on her wasted form.
To watch her children hour by hour, to sit by me, drinking deep the dear persuasion that I remained to her, was all her pastime.
Her vivacity, so long assumed, her affectionate display of cheerfulness, her light-hearted tone and springy gait were gone.
I could not disguise to myself, nor could she conceal, her life-consuming sorrow.
Still change of scene, and reviving hopes might restore her; I feared the plague only, and she was untouched by that.
I had left her this evening, reposing after the fatigues of her preparations.
Clara sat beside her, relating a story to the two boys.
The eyes of Idris were closed: but Clara perceived a sudden change in the appearance of our eldest darling; his heavy lids veiled his eyes, an unnatural colour burnt in his cheeks, his breath became short.
Clara looked at the mother; she slept, yet started at the pause the narrator made-- Fear of awakening and alarming her, caused Clara to go on at the eager call of Evelyn, who was unaware of what was passing.
Her eyes turned alternately from Alfred to Idris; with trembling accents she continued her tale, till she saw the child about to fall: starting forward she caught him, and her cry roused Idris.
She looked on her son.
She saw death stealing across his features; she laid him on a bed, she held drink to his parched lips.
Yet he might be saved.
If I were there, he might be saved; perhaps it was not the plague.
Without a counsellor, what could she do?
stay and behold him die!
Why at that moment was I away?
"Look to him, Clara," she exclaimed, "I will return immediately".
She inquired among those who, selected as the companions of our journey, had taken up their residence in our house; she heard from them merely that I had gone out with Adrian.
She entreated them to seek me: she returned to her child, he was plunged in a frightful state of torpor; again she rushed down stairs; all was dark, desert, and silent; she lost all self-possession; she ran into the street; she called on my name.
The pattering rain and howling wind alone replied to her.
Wild fear gave wings to her feet; she darted forward to seek me, she knew not where; but, putting all her thoughts, all her energy, all her being in speed only, most misdirected speed, she neither felt, nor feared, nor paused, but ran right on, till her
Her knees failed her, and she fell heavily on the pavement.
She was stunned for a time; but at length rose, and though sorely hurt, still walked on, shedding a fountain of tears, stumbling at times, going she knew not whither, only now and then with feeble voice she called my name, adding with heart-piercing
Human being there was none to reply; and the inclemency of the night had driven the wandering animals to the habitations they had usurped.
Her thin dress was drenched with rain; her wet hair clung round her neck; she tottered through the dark streets; till, striking her foot against an unseen impediment, she again fell; she could not rise; she hardly strove; but, gathering up her limbs, she
She breathed an earnest prayer to die speedily, for there was no relief but death.
While hopeless of safety for herself, she ceased to lament for her dying child, but shed kindly, bitter tears for the grief I should experience in losing her.
While she lay, life almost suspended, she felt a warm, soft hand on her brow, and a gentle female voice asked her, with expressions of tender compassion, if she could not rise?
That another human being, sympathetic and kind, should exist near, roused her; half rising, with clasped hands, and fresh springing tears, she entreated her companion to seek for me, to bid me hasten to my dying child, to save him, for the love of heaven,
The woman raised her; she led her under shelter, she entreated her to return to her home, whither perhaps I had already returned.
Idris easily yielded to her persuasions, she leaned on the arm of her friend, she endeavoured to walk on, but irresistible faintness made her pause again and again.
Quickened by the encreasing storm, we had hastened our return, our little charge was placed before Adrian on his horse.
There was an assemblage of persons under the portico of our house, in whose gestures I instinctively read some heavy change, some new misfortune.
With swift alarm, afraid to ask a single question, I leapt from my horse; the spectators saw me, knew me, and in awful silence divided to make way for me.
I snatched a light, and rushing up stairs, and hearing a groan, without reflection I threw open the door of the first room that presented itself.
It was quite dark; but, as I stept within, a pernicious scent assailed my senses, producing sickening qualms, which made their way to my very heart, while I felt my leg clasped, and a groan repeated by the person that held me.
I lowered my lamp, and saw a negro half clad, writhing under the agony of disease, while he held me with a convulsive grasp.
With mixed horror and impatience I strove to disengage myself, and fell on the sufferer; he wound his naked festering arms round me, his face was close to mine, and his breath, death-laden, entered my vitals.
For a moment I was overcome, my head was bowed by aching nausea; till, reflection returning, I sprung up, threw the wretch from me, and darting up the staircase, entered the chamber usually inhabited by my family.
A dim light shewed me Alfred on a couch; Clara trembling, and paler than whitest snow, had raised him on her arm, holding a cup of water to his lips.
I saw full well that no spark of life existed in that ruined form, his features were rigid, his eyes glazed, his head had fallen back.
I took him from her, I laid him softly down, kissed his cold little mouth, and turned to speak in a vain whisper, when loudest sound of thunderlike cannon could not have reached him in his immaterial abode.
And where was Idris?
That she had gone out to seek me, and had not returned, were fearful tidings, while the rain and driving wind clattered against the window, and roared round the house.
Added to this, the sickening sensation of disease gained upon me; no time was to be lost, if ever I would see her again.
I mounted my horse and rode out to seek her, fancying that I heard her voice in every gust, oppressed by fever and aching pain.
I rode in the dark and rain through the labyrinthine streets of unpeopled London.
My child lay dead at home; the seeds of mortal disease had taken root in my bosom; I went to seek Idris, my adored, now wandering alone, while the waters were rushing from heaven like a cataract to bathe her dear head in chill damp, her fair limbs in
A female stood on the step of a door, and called to me as I gallopped past.
It was not Idris; so I rode swiftly on, until a kind of second sight, a reflection back again on my senses of what I had seen but not marked, made me feel sure that another figure, thin, graceful and tall, stood clinging to the foremost person who
In a minute I was beside the suppliant, in a minute I received the sinking Idris in my arms.
Lifting her up, I placed her on the horse; she had not strength to support herself; so I mounted behind her, and held her close to my bosom, wrapping my riding-cloak round her, while her companion, whose well known, but changed countenance, (it was Juliet,
She took the abandoned rein, and conducted our obedient steed homewards.
Dare I avouch it?
That was the last moment of my happiness; but I was happy.
Idris must die, for her heart was broken: I must die, for I had caught the plague; earth was a scene of desolation; hope was madness; life had married death; they were one; but, thus supporting my fainting love, thus feeling that I must soon die, I
We arrived at our home.
I assisted her to dismount, I carried her up stairs, and gave her into Clara's care, that her wet garments might be changed.
Briefly I assured Adrian of her safety, and requested that we might be left to repose.
As the miser, who with trembling caution visits his treasure to count it again and again, so I numbered each moment, and grudged every one that was not spent with Idris.
I returned swiftly to the chamber where the life of my life reposed; before I entered the room I paused for a few seconds; for a few seconds I tried to examine my state; sickness and shuddering ever and anon came over me; my head was heavy, my chest
She was lying on a couch; carefully fastening the door to prevent all intrusion; I sat by her, we embraced, and our lips met in a kiss long drawn and breathless--would that moment had been my last!
Maternal feeling now awoke in my poor girl's bosom, and she asked: "And Alfred"?
"Idris," I replied, "we are spared to each other, we are together; do not let any other idea intrude.
I am happy; even on this fatal night, I declare myself happy, beyond all name, all thought--what would you more, sweet one"?
Idris understood me: she bowed her head on my shoulder and wept.
"Why," she again asked, "do you tremble, Lionel, what shakes you thus"?
"Well may I be shaken," I replied, "happy as I am.
Our child is dead, and the present hour is dark and ominous.
Well may I tremble!
but, I am happy, mine own Idris, most happy".
"I understand thee, my kind love," said Idris, "thus--pale as thou art with sorrow at our loss; trembling and aghast, though wouldest assuage my grief by thy dear assurances.
I am not happy," (and the tears flashed and fell from under her down-cast lids), "for we are inmates of a miserable prison, and there is no joy for us; but the true love I bear you will render this and every other loss endurable".
"We have been happy together, at least," I said; "no future misery can deprive us of the past.
We have been true to each other for years, ever since my sweet princess-love came through the snow to the lowly cottage of the poverty-striken heir of the ruined Verney.
Even now, that eternity is before us, we take hope only from the presence of each other.
Idris, do you think, that when we die, we shall be divided"?
"Die!
when we die!
what mean you?
What secret lies hid from me in those dreadful words"?
"Must we not all die, dearest"?
I asked with a sad smile.
"Gracious God!
are you ill, Lionel, that you speak of death?
My only friend, heart of my heart, speak"!
"I do not think," replied I, "that we have any of us long to live; and when the curtain drops on this mortal scene, where, think you, we shall find ourselves"?
Idris was calmed by my unembarrassed tone and look; she answered:--"You may easily believe that during this long progress of the plague, I have thought much on death, and asked myself, now that all mankind is dead to this life, to what other life they may
Hour after hour, I have dwelt on these thoughts, and strove to form a rational conclusion concerning the mystery of a future state.
What a scare-crow, indeed, would death be, if we were merely to cast aside the shadow in which we now walk, and, stepping forth into the unclouded sunshine of knowledge and love, revived with the same companions, the same affections, and reached the
Alas!
the same strong feeling which makes me sure that I shall not wholly die, makes me refuse to believe that I shall live wholly as I do now.
Yet, Lionel, never, never, can I love any but you; through eternity I must desire your society; and, as I am innocent of harm to others, and as relying and confident as my mortal nature permits, I trust that the Ruler of the world will never tear us
"Your remarks are like yourself, dear love," replied I, "gentle and good; let us cherish such a belief, and dismiss anxiety from our minds.
But, sweet, we are so formed, (and there is no sin, if God made our nature, to yield to what he ordains), we are so formed, that we must love life, and cling to it; we must love the living smile, the sympathetic touch, and thrilling voice, peculiar to our
Let us not, through security in hereafter, neglect the present.
This present moment, short as it is, is a part of eternity, and the dearest part, since it is our own unalienably.
Thou, the hope of my futurity, art my present joy.
Let me then look on thy dear eyes, and, reading love in them, drink intoxicating pleasure".
Timidly, for my vehemence somewhat terrified her, Idris looked on me.
My eyes were bloodshot, starting from my head; every artery beat, methought, audibly, every muscle throbbed, each single nerve felt.
Her look of wild affright told me, that I could no longer keep my secret:--"So it is, mine own beloved," I said, "the last hour of many happy ones is arrived, nor can we shun any longer the inevitable destiny.
I cannot live long--but, again and again, I say, this moment is ours"!
Paler than marble, with white lips and convulsed features, Idris became aware of my situation.
My arm, as I sat, encircled her waist.
She felt the palm burn with fever, even on the heart it pressed:--"One moment," she murmured, scarce audibly, "only one moment".
-- She kneeled, and hiding her face in her hands, uttered a brief, but earnest prayer, that she might fulfil her duty, and watch over me to the last.
While there was hope, the agony had been unendurable;--all was now concluded; her feelings became solemn and calm.
Even as Epicharis, unperturbed and firm, submitted to the instruments of torture, did Idris, suppressing every sigh and sign of grief, enter upon the endurance of torments, of which the rack and the wheel are but faint and metaphysical symbols.
I was changed; the tight-drawn cord that sounded so harshly was loosened, the moment that Idris participated in my knowledge of our real situation.
The perturbed and passion-tossed waves of thought subsided, leaving only the heavy swell that kept right on without any outward manifestation of its disturbance, till it should break on the remote shore towards which I rapidly advanced:--"It is true that I
She made me lie down on the couch, and, drawing a low ottoman near, sat close to my pillow, pressing my burning hands in her cold palms.
She yielded to my feverish restlessness, and let me talk, and talked to me, on subjects strange indeed to beings, who thus looked the last, and heard the last, of what they loved alone in the world.
We talked of times gone by; of the happy period of our early love; of Raymond, Perdita, and Evadne.
We talked of what might arise on this desert earth, if, two or three being saved, it were slowly re-peopled.
--We talked of what was beyond the tomb; and, man in his human shape being nearly extinct, we felt with certainty of faith, that other spirits, other minds, other perceptive beings, sightless to us, must people with thought and love this beauteous and
We talked--I know not how long--but, in the morning I awoke from a painful heavy slumber; the pale cheek of Idris rested on my pillow; the large orbs of her eyes half raised the lids, and shewed the deep blue lights beneath; her lips were unclosed, and the
"If she were dead," I thought, "what difference?
now that form is the temple of a residing deity; those eyes are the windows of her soul; all grace, love, and intelligence are throned on that lovely bosom--were she dead, where would this mind, the dearer half of mine, be?
For quickly the fair proportion of this edifice would be more defaced, than are the sand-choked ruins of the desert temples of Palmyra".
CHAPTER III.
IDRIS stirred and awoke; alas!
she awoke to misery.
She saw the signs of disease on my countenance, and wondered how she could permit the long night to pass without her having sought, not cure, that was impossible, but alleviation to my sufferings.
She called Adrian; my couch was quickly surrounded by friends and assistants, and such medicines as were judged fitting were administered.
It was the peculiar and dreadful distinction of our visitation, that none who had been attacked by the pestilence had recovered.
The first symptom of the disease was the death-warrant, which in no single instance had been followed by pardon or reprieve.
No gleam of hope therefore cheered my friends.
While fever producing torpor, heavy pains, sitting like lead on my limbs, and making my breast heave, were upon me; I continued insensible to every thing but pain, and at last even to that.
I awoke on the fourth morning as from a dreamless sleep.
An irritating sense of thirst, and, when I strove to speak or move, an entire dereliction of power, was all I felt.
For three days and nights Idris had not moved from my side.
She administered to all my wants, and never slept nor rested.
She did not hope; and therefore she neither endeavoured to read the physician's countenance, nor to watch for symptoms of recovery.
All her thought was to attend on me to the last, and then to lie down and die beside me.
On the third night animation was suspended; to the eye and touch of all I was dead.
With earnest prayer, almost with force, Adrian tried to draw Idris from me.
He exhausted every adjuration, her child's welfare and his own.
She shook her head, and wiped a stealing tear from her sunk cheek, but would not yield; she entreated to be allowed to watch me that one night only, with such affliction and meek earnestness, that she gained her point, and sat silent and motionless, except
At dead of night, when, though it was mid winter, the cock crowed at three o'clock, as herald of the morning change, while hanging over me, and mourning in silent, bitter thought for the loss of all of love towards her that had been enshrined in my heart;
It is not so, she thought, for he will never breathe more.
Several times the same thing occurred, and she only marked it by the same reflection; till the whole ringlet waved back, and she thought she saw my breast heave.
Her first emotion was deadly fear, cold dew stood on her brow; my eyes half opened; and, re-assured, she would have exclaimed, "He lives"!
but the words were choked by a spasm, and she fell with a groan on the floor.
Adrian was in the chamber.
After long watching, he had unwillingly fallen into a sleep.
He started up, and beheld his sister senseless on the earth, weltering in a stream of blood that gushed from her mouth.
Encreasing signs of life in me in some degree explained her state; the surprise, the burst of joy, the revulsion of every sentiment, had been too much for her frame, worn by long months of care, late shattered by every species of woe and toil.
She was now in far greater danger than I, the wheels and springs of my life, once again set in motion, acquired elasticity from their short suspension.
For a long time, no one believed that I should indeed continue to live; during the reign of the plague upon earth, not one person, attacked by the grim disease, had recovered.
My restoration was looked on as a deception; every moment it was expected that the evil symptoms would recur with redoubled violence, until confirmed convalescence, absence of all fever or pain, and encreasing strength, brought slow conviction that I had
The restoration of Idris was more problematical.
When I had been attacked by illness, her cheeks were sunk, her form emaciated; but now, the vessel, which had broken from the effects of extreme agitation, did not entirely heal, but was as a channel that drop by drop drew from her the ruddy stream that
Her hollow eyes and worn countenance had a ghastly appearance; her cheek-bones, her open fair brow, the projection of the mouth, stood fearfully prominent; you might tell each bone in the thin anatomy of her frame.
Her hand hung powerless; each joint lay bare, so that the light penetrated through and through.
It was strange that life could exist in what was wasted and worn into a very type of death.
To take her from these heart-breaking scenes, to lead her to forget the world's desolation in the variety of objects presented by travelling, and to nurse her failing strength in the mild climate towards which we had resolved to journey, was my last hope
The preparations for our departure, which had been suspended during my illness, were renewed.
I did not revive to doubtful convalescence; health spent her treasures upon me; as the tree in spring may feel from its wrinkled limbs the fresh green break forth, and the living sap rise and circulate, so did the renewed vigour of my frame, the cheerful
My body, late the heavy weight that bound me to the tomb, was exuberant with health; mere common exercises were insufficient for my reviving strength; methought I could emulate the speed of the race-horse, discern through the air objects at a blinding
Hope, among my other blessings, was not denied to me; and I did fondly trust that my unwearied attentions would restore my adored girl.
I was therefore eager to forward our preparations.
According to the plan first laid down, we were to have quitted London on the twenty-fifth of November; and, in pursuance of this scheme, two-thirds of our people--thepeople-- all that remained of England, had gone forward, and had already been some weeks
First my illness, and subsequently that of Idris, had detained Adrian with his division, which consisted of three hundred persons, so that we now departed on the first of January, 2098.
It was my wish to keep Idris as distant as possible from the hurry and clamour of the crowd, and to hide from her those appearances that would remind her most forcibly of our real situation.
We separated ourselves to a great degree from Adrian, who was obliged to give his whole time to public business.
The Countess of Windsor travelled with her son.
Clara, Evelyn, and a female who acted as our attendant, were the only persons with whom we had contact.
We occupied a commodious carriage, our servant officiated as coachman.
A party of about twenty persons preceded us at a small distance.
They had it in charge to prepare our halting places and our nightly abode.
They had been selected for this service out of a great number that offered, on account of the superior sagacity of the man who had been appointed their leader.
Immediately on our departure, I was delighted to find a change in Idris, which I fondly hoped prognosticated the happiest results.
All the cheerfulness and gentle gaiety natural to her revived.
She was weak, and this alteration was rather displayed in looks and voice than in acts; but it was permanent and real.
My recovery from the plague and confirmed health instilled into her a firm belief that I was now secure from this dread enemy.
She told me that she was sure she should recover.
That she had a presentiment, that the tide of calamity which deluged our unhappy race had now turned.
That the remnant would be preserved, and among them the dear objects of her tender affection; and that in some selected spot we should wear out our lives together in pleasant society.
"Do not let my state of feebleness deceive you," she said; "I feel that I am better; there is a quick life within me, and a spirit of anticipation that assures me, that I shall continue long to make a part of this world.
I shall throw off this degrading weakness of body, which infects even my mind with debility, and I shall enter again on the performance of my duties.
I was sorry to leave Windsor: but now I am weaned from this local attachment; I am content to remove to a mild climate, which will complete my recovery.
Trust me, dearest, I shall neither leave you, nor my brother, nor these dear children; my firm determination to remain with you to the last, and to continue to contribute to your happiness and welfare, would keep me alive, even if grim death were nearer at
I was only half re-assured by these expressions; I could not believe that the over-quick flow of her blood was a sign of health, or that her burning cheeks denoted convalescence.
But I had no fears of an immediate catastrophe; nay, I persuaded myself that she would ultimately recover.
And thus cheerfulness reigned in our little society.
Idris conversed with animation on a thousand topics.
Her chief desire was to lead our thoughts from melancholy reflections; so she drew charming pictures of a tranquil solitude, of a beauteous retreat, of the simple manners of our little tribe, and of the patriarchal brotherhood of love, which would survive
We shut out from our thoughts the present, and withdrew our eyes from the dreary landscape we traversed.
Winter reigned in all its gloom.
The leafless trees lay without motion against the dun sky; the forms of frost, mimicking the foliage of summer, strewed the ground; the paths were overgrown; the unploughed cornfields were patched with grass and weeds; the sheep congregated at the
The wind was bleak, and frequent sleet or snow-storms, added to the melancholy appearance wintry nature assumed.
We arrived at Rochester, and an accident caused us to be detained there a day.
During that time, a circumstance occurred that changed our plans, and which, alas!
in its result changed the eternal course of events, turning me from the pleasant new sprung hope I enjoyed, to an obscure and gloomy desert.
But I must give some little explanation before I proceed with the final cause of our temporary alteration of plan, and refer again to those times when man walked the earth fearless, before Plague had become Queen of the World.
There resided a family in the neighbourhood of Windsor, of very humble pretensions, but which had been an object of interest to us on account of one of the persons of whom it was composed.
The family of the Claytons had known better days; but, after a series of reverses, the father died a bankrupt, and the mother heartbroken, and a confirmed invalid, retired with her five children to a little cottage between Eton and Salt Hill.
The eldest of these children, who was thirteen years old, seemed at once from the influence of adversity, to acquire the sagacity and principle belonging to a more mature age.
Her mother grew worse and worse in health, but Lucy attended on her, and was as a tender parent to her younger brothers and sisters, and in the meantime shewed herself so good-humoured, social, and benevolent, that she was beloved as well as honoured, in
Lucy was besides extremely pretty; so when she grew to be sixteen, it was to be supposed, notwithstanding her poverty, that she should have admirers.
One of these was the son of a country-curate; he was a generous, frank-hearted youth, with an ardent love of knowledge, and no mean acquirements.
Though Lucy was untaught, her mother's conversation and manners gave her a taste for refinements superior to her present situation.
She loved the youth even without knowing it, except that in any difficulty she naturally turned to him for aid, and awoke with a lighter heart every Sunday, because she knew that she would be met and accompanied by him in her evening walk with her sisters.
She had another admirer, one of the head-waiters at the inn at Salt Hill.
He also was not without pretensions to urbane superiority, such as he learnt from gentlemen's servants and waiting-maids, who initiating him in all the slang of high life below stairs, rendered his arrogant temper ten times more intrusive.
Lucy did not disclaim him--she was incapable of that feeling; but she was sorry when she saw him approach, and quietly resisted all his endeavours to establish an intimacy.
The fellow soon discovered that his rival was preferred to him; and this changed what was at first a chance admiration into a passion, whose main springs were envy, and a base desire to deprive his competitor of the advantage he enjoyed over himself.
Poor Lucy's sad story was but a common one.
Her lover's father died; and he was left destitute.
He accepted the offer of a gentleman to go to India with him, feeling secure that he should soon acquire an independence, and return to claim the hand of his beloved.
He became involved in the war carried on there, was taken prisoner, and years elapsed before tidings of his existence were received in his native land.
In the meantime disastrous poverty came on Lucy.
Her little cottage, which stood looking from its trellice, covered with woodbine and jessamine, was burnt down; and the whole of their little property was included in the destruction.
Whither betake them?
By what exertion of industry could Lucy procure them another abode?
Her mother nearly bed-rid, could not survive any extreme of famine-struck poverty.
At this time her other admirer stept forward, and renewed his offer of marriage.
He had saved money, and was going to set up a little inn at Datchet.
There was nothing alluring to Lucy in this offer, except the home it secured to her mother; and she felt more sure of this, since she was struck by the apparent generosity which occasioned the present offer.
She accepted it; thus sacrificing herself for the comfort and welfare of her parent.
It was some years after her marriage that we became acquainted with her.
The accident of a storm caused us to take refuge in the inn, where we witnessed the brutal and quarrelsome behaviour of her husband, and her patient endurance.
Her lot was not a fortunate one.
Her first lover had returned with the hope of making her his own, and met her by accident, for the first time, as the mistress of his country inn, and the wife of another.
He withdrew despairingly to foreign parts; nothing went well with him; at last he enlisted, and came back again wounded and sick, and yet Lucy was debarred from nursing him.
Her husband's brutal disposition was aggravated by his yielding to the many temptations held out by his situation, and the consequent disarrangement of his affairs.
Fortunately she had no children; but her heart was bound up in her brothers and sisters, and these his avarice and ill temper soon drove from the house; they were dispersed about the country, earning their livelihood with toil and care.
He even shewed an inclination to get rid of her mother--but Lucy was firm here--she had sacrificed herself for her; she lived for her --she would not part with her--if the mother went, she would also go beg bread for her, die with her, but never desert
The presence of Lucy was too necessary in keeping up the order of the house, and in preventing the whole establishment from going to wreck, for him to permit her to leave him.
He yielded the point; but in all accesses of anger, or in his drunken fits, he recurred to the old topic, and stung poor Lucy's heart by opprobrious epithets bestowed on her parent.
A passion however, if it be wholly pure, entire, and reciprocal, brings with it its own solace.
Lucy was truly, and from the depth of heart, devoted to her mother; the sole end she proposed to herself in life, was the comfort and preservation of this parent.
Though she grieved for the result, yet she did not repent of her marriage, even when her lover returned to bestow competence on her.
Three years had intervened, and how, in their pennyless state, could her mother have existed during this time?
This excellent woman was worthy of her child's devotion.
A perfect confidence and friendship existed between them; besides, she was by no means illiterate; and Lucy, whose mind had been in some degree cultivated by her former lover, now found in her the only person who could understand and appreciate her.
Thus, though suffering, she was by no means desolate, and when, during fine summer days, she led her mother into the flowery and shady lanes near their abode, a gleam of unmixed joy enlightened her countenance; she saw that her parent was happy, and she
Meanwhile her husband's affairs grew more and more involved; ruin was near at hand, and she was about to lose the fruit of all her labours, when pestilence came to change the aspect of the world.
Her husband reaped benefit from the universal misery; but, as the disaster encreased, the spirit of lawlessness seized him; he deserted his home to revel in the luxuries promised him in London, and found there a grave.
Her former lover had been one of the first victims of the disease.
But Lucy continued to live for and in her mother.
Her courage only failed when she dreaded peril for her parent, or feared that death might prevent her from performing those duties to which she was unalterably devoted.
When we had quitted Windsor for London, as the previous step to our final emigration, we visited Lucy, and arranged with her the plan of her own and her mother's removal.
Lucy was sorry at the necessity which forced her to quit her native lanes and village, and to drag an infirm parent from her comforts at home, to the homeless waste of depopulate earth; but she was too well disciplined by adversity, and of too sweet a
Subsequent circumstances, my illness and that of Idris, drove her from our remembrance; and we called her to mind at last, only to conclude that she made one of the few who came from Windsor to join the emigrants, and that she was already in Paris.
When we arrived at Rochester therefore, we were surprised to receive, by a man just come from Slough, a letter from this exemplary sufferer.
His account was, that, journeying from his home, and passing through Datchet, he was surprised to see smoke issue from the chimney of the inn, and supposing that he should find comrades for his journey assembled there, he knocked and was admitted.
There was no one in the house but Lucy, and her mother; the latter had been deprived of the use of her limbs by an attack of rheumatism, and so, one by one, all the remaining inhabitants of the country set forward, leaving them alone.
Lucy intreated the man to stay with her; in a week or two her mother would be better, and they would then set out; but they must perish, if they were left thus helpless and forlorn.
The man said, that his wife and children were already among the emigrants, and it was therefore, according to his notion, impossible for him to remain.
Lucy, as a last resource, gave him a letter for Idris, to be delivered to her wherever he should meet us.
This commission at least he fulfilled, and Idris received with emotion the following letter:-- "HONOURED LADY, "I am sure that you will remember and pity me, and I dare hope that you will assist me; what other hope have I?
Pardon my manner of writing, I am so bewildered.
A month ago my dear mother was deprived of the use of her limbs.
She is already better, and in another month would I am sure be able to travel, in the way you were so kind as to say you would arrange for us.
But now everybody is gone--everybody--as they went away, each said, that perhaps my mother would be better, before we were quite deserted.
But three days ago I went to Samuel Woods, who, on account of his new-born child, remained to the last; and there being a large family of them, I thought I could persuade them to wait a little longer for us; but I found the house deserted.
I have not seen a soul since, till this good man came.
--What will become of us?
My mother does not know our state; she is so ill, that I have hidden it from her.
"Will you not send some one to us?
I am sure we must perish miserably as we are.
If I were to try to move my mother now, she would die on the road; and if, when she gets better, I were able, I cannot guess how, to find out the roads, and get on so many many miles to the sea, you would all be in France, and the great ocean would be
What would it be to me, a woman, who never saw it?
We should be imprisoned by it in this country, all, all alone, with no help; better die where we are.
I can hardly write--I cannot stop my tears--it is not for myself; I could put my trust in God; and let the worst come, I think I could bear it, if I were alone.
But my mother, my sick, my dear, dear mother, who never, since I was born, spoke a harsh word to me, who has been patient in many sufferings; pity her, dear Lady, she must die a miserable death if you do not pity her.
People speak carelessly of her, because she is old and infirm, as if we must not all, if we are spared, become so; and then, when the young are old themselves, they will think that they ought to be taken care of.
It is very silly of me to write in this way to you; but, when I hear her trying not to groan, and see her look smiling on me to comfort me, when I know she is in pain; and when I think that she does not know the worst, but she soon must; and then she will
Preserve her, Lady, and He will bless you; and I, poor miserable creature as I am, will thank you and pray for you while I live.
"Your unhappy and dutiful servant, "Dec.
30th, 2097.
LUCY MARTIN".
This letter deeply affected Idris, and she instantly proposed, that we should return to Datchet, to assist Lucy and her mother.
I said that I would without delay set out for that place, but entreated her to join her brother, and there await my return with the children.
But Idris was in high spirits, and full of hope.
She declared that she could not consent even to a temporary separation from me, but that there was no need of this, the motion of the carriage did her good, and the distance was too trifling to be considered.
We could dispatch messengers to Adrian, to inform him of our deviation from the original plan.
She spoke with vivacity, and drew a picture after her own dear heart, of the pleasure we should bestow upon Lucy, and declared, if I went, she must accompany me, and that she should very much dislike to entrust the charge of rescuing them to others, who
Lucy's life had been one act of devotion and virtue; let her now reap the small reward of finding her excellence appreciated, and her necessity assisted, by those whom she respected and honoured.
These, and many other arguments, were urged with gentle pertinacity, and the ardour of a wish to do all the good in her power, by her whose simple expression of a desire and slightest request had ever been a law with me.
I, of course, consented, the moment that I saw that she had set her heart upon this step.
We sent half our attendant troop on to Adrian; and with the other half our carriage took a retrograde course back to Windsor.
I wonder now how I could be so blind and senseless, as thus to risk the safety of Idris; for, if I had eyes, surely I could see the sure, though deceitful, advance of death in her burning cheek and encreasing weakness.
But she said she was better; and I believed her.
Extinction could not be near a being, whose vivacity and intelligence hourly encreased, and whose frame was endowed with an intense, and I fondly thought, a strong and permanent spirit of life.
Who, after a great disaster, has not looked back with wonder at his inconceivable obtuseness of understanding, that could not perceive the many minute threads with which fate weaves the inextricable net of our destinies, until he is inmeshed completely in
The cross roads which we now entered upon, were even in a worse state than the long neglected high-ways; and the inconvenience seemed to menace the perishing frame of Idris with destruction.
Passing through Dartford, we arrived at Hampton on the second day.
Even in this short interval my beloved companion grew sensibly worse in health, though her spirits were still light, and she cheered my growing anxiety with gay sallies; sometimes the thought pierced my brain--Is she dying?
--as I saw her fair fleshless hand rest on mine, or observed the feebleness with which she performed the accustomed acts of life.
I drove away the idea, as if it had been suggested by insanity; but it occurred again and again, only to be dispelled by the continued liveliness of her manner.
About mid-day, after quitting Hampton, our carriage broke down: the shock caused Idris to faint, but on her reviving no other ill consequence ensued; our party of attendants had as usual gone on before us, and our coachman went in search of another
The only place near us was a poor village, in which he found a kind of caravan, able to hold four people, but it was clumsy and ill hung; besides this he found a very excellent cabriolet: our plan was soon arranged; I would drive Idris in the latter; while
But these arrangements cost time; we had agreed to proceed that night to Windsor, and thither our purveyors had gone: we should find considerable difficulty in getting accommodation, before we reached this place; after all, the distance was only ten miles;
Evening closed in quickly, far more quickly than I was prepared to expect.
At the going down of the sun it began to snow heavily.
I attempted in vain to defend my beloved companion from the storm; the wind drove the snow in our faces; and it lay so high on the ground, that we made but small way; while the night was so dark, that but for the white covering on the ground we should not
We had left our accompanying caravan far behind us; and now I perceived that the storm had made me unconsciously deviate from my intended route.
I had gone some miles out of my way.
My knowledge of the country enabled me to regain the right road; but, instead of going, as at first agreed upon, by a cross road through Stanwell to Datchet, I was obliged to take the way of Egham and Bishopgate.
It was certain therefore that I should not be rejoined by the other vehicle, that I should not meet a single fellow-creature till we arrived at Windsor.
The back of our carriage was drawn up, and I hung a pelisse before it, thus to curtain the beloved sufferer from the pelting sleet.
She leaned on my shoulder, growing every moment more languid and feeble; at first she replied to my words of cheer with affectionate thanks; but by degrees she sunk into silence; her head lay heavily upon me; I only knew that she lived by her irregular
For a moment I resolved to stop, and, opposing the back of the cabriolet to the force of the tempest, to expect morning as well as I might.
But the wind was bleak and piercing, while the occasional shudderings of my poor Idris, and the intense cold I felt myself, demonstrated that this would be a dangerous experiment.
At length methought she slept--fatal sleep, induced by frost: at this moment I saw the heavy outline of a cottage traced on the dark horizon close to us: "Dearest love," I said, "support yourself but one moment, and we shall have shelter; let us stop here,
As I spoke, my heart was transported, and my senses swam with excessive delight and thankfulness; I placed the head of Idris against the carriage, and, leaping out, scrambled through the snow to the cottage, whose door was open.
I had apparatus about me for procuring light, and that shewed me a comfortable room, with a pile of wood in one corner, and no appearance of disorder, except that, the door having been left partly open, the snow, drifting in, had blocked up the threshold.
I returned to the carriage, and the sudden change from light to darkness at first blinded me.
When I recovered my sight--eternal God of this lawless world!
O supreme Death!
I will not disturb thy silent reign, or mar my tale with fruitless exclamations of horror--I saw Idris, who had fallen from the seat to the bottom of the carriage; her head, its long hair pendent, with one arm, hung over the side.
--Struck by a spasm of horror, I lifted her up; her heart was pulseless, her faded lips unfanned by the slightest breath.
I carried her into the cottage; I placed her on the bed.
Lighting a fire, I chafed her stiffening limbs; for two long hours I sought to restore departed life; and, when hope was as dead as my beloved, I closed with trembling hands her glazed eyes.
I did not doubt what I should now do.
In the confusion attendant on my illness, the task of interring our darling Alfred had devolved on his grandmother, the Ex-Queen, and she, true to her ruling passion, had caused him to be carried to Windsor, and buried in the family vault, in St. George's
I must proceed to Windsor, to calm the anxiety of Clara, who would wait anxiously for us--yet I would fain spare her the heart-breaking spectacle of Idris, brought in by me lifeless from the journey.
So first I would place my beloved beside her child in the vault, and then seek the poor children who would be expecting me.
I lighted the lamps of my carriage; I wrapt her in furs, and placed her along the seat; then taking the reins, made the horses go forward.
We proceeded through the snow, which lay in masses impeding the way, while the descending flakes, driving against me with redoubled fury, blinded me.
The pain occasioned by the angry elements, and the cold iron of the shafts of frost which buffetted me, and entered my aching flesh, were a relief to me; blunting my mental suffering.
The horses staggered on, and the reins hung loosely in my hands.
I often thought I would lay my head close to the sweet, cold face of my lost angel, and thus resign myself to conquering torpor.
Yet I must not leave her a prey to the fowls of the air; but, in pursuance of my determination place her in the tomb of her forefathers, where a merciful God might permit me to rest also.
The road we passed through Egham was familiar to me; but the wind and snow caused the horses to drag their load slowly and heavily.
Suddenly the wind veered from south-west to west, and then again to north-west.
As Sampson with tug and strain stirred from their bases the columns that supported the Philistine temple, so did the gale shake the dense vapours propped on the horizon, while the massy dome of clouds fell to the south, disclosing through the scattered web
Even the horses were cheered, and moved on with renovated strength.
We entered the forest at Bishopgate, and at the end of the Long Walk I saw the Castle, "the proud Keep of Windsor, rising in the majesty of proportion, girt with the double belt of its kindred and coeval towers".
I looked with reverence on a structure, ancient almost as the rock on which it stood, abode of kings, theme of admiration for the wise.
With greater reverence and, tearful affection I beheld it as the asylum of the long lease of love I had enjoyed there with the perishable, unmatchable treasure of dust, which now lay cold beside me.
Now indeed, I could have yielded to all the softness of my nature, and wept; and, womanlike, have uttered bitter plaints; while the familiar trees, the herds of living deer, the sward oft prest by her fairy-feet, one by one with sad association presented
The white gate at the end of the Long Walk was wide open, and I rode up the empty town through the first gate of the feudal tower; and now St. George's Chapel, with its blackened fretted sides, was right before me.
I halted at its door, which was open; I entered, and placed my lighted lamp on the altar; then I returned, and with tender caution I bore Idris up the aisle into the chancel, and laid her softly down on the carpet which covered the step leading to the
The banners of the knights of the garter, and their half drawn swords, were hung in vain emblazonry above the stalls.
The banner of her family hung there, still surmounted by its regal crown.
Farewell to the glory and heraldry of England!
--I turned from such vanity with a slight feeling of wonder, at how mankind could have ever been interested in such things.
I bent over the lifeless corpse of my beloved; and, while looking on her uncovered face, the features already contracted by the rigidity of death, I felt as if all the visible universe had grown as soulless, inane, and comfortless as the clay-cold image
I felt for a moment the intolerable sense of struggle with, and detestation for, the laws which govern the world; till the calm still visible on the face of my dead love recalled me to a more soothing tone of mind, and I proceeded to fulfil the last office
For her I could not lament, so much I envied her enjoyment of "the sad immunities of the grave".
The vault had been lately opened to place our Alfred therein.
The ceremony customary in these latter days had been cursorily performed, and the pavement of the chapel, which was its entrance, having been removed, had not been replaced.
I descended the steps, and walked through the long passage to the large vault which contained the kindred dust of my Idris.
I distinguished the small coffin of my babe.
With hasty, trembling hands I constructed a bier beside it, spreading it with the furs and Indian shawls, which had wrapt Idris in her journey thither.
I lighted the glimmering lamp, which flickered in this damp abode of the dead; then I bore my lost one to her last bed, decently composing her limbs, and covering them with a mantle, veiling all except her face, which remained lovely and placid.
She appeared to rest like one over-wearied, her beauteous eyes steeped in sweet slumber.
Yet, so it was not--she was dead!
How intensely I then longed to lie down beside her, to gaze till death should gather me to the same repose.
But death does not come at the bidding of the miserable.
I had lately recovered from mortal illness, and my blood had never flowed with such an even current, nor had my limbs ever been so instinct with quick life, as now.
I felt that my death must be voluntary.
Yet what more natural than famine, as I watched in this chamber of mortality, placed in a world of the dead, beside the lost hope of my life?
Meanwhile as I looked on her, the features, which bore a sisterly resemblance to Adrian, brought my thoughts back again to the living, to this dear friend, to Clara, and to Evelyn, who were probably now in Windsor, waiting anxiously for our arrival.
Methought I heard a noise, a step in the far chapel, which was re-echoed by its vaulted roof, and borne to me through the hollow passages.
Had Clara seen my carriage pass up the town, and did she seek me here?
I must save her at least from the horrible scene the vault presented.
I sprung up the steps, and then saw a female figure, bent with age, and clad in long mourning robes, advance through the dusky chapel, supported by a slender cane, yet tottering even with this support.
She heard me, and looked up; the lamp I held illuminated my figure, and the moon-beams, struggling through the painted glass, fell upon her face, wrinkled and gaunt, yet with a piercing eye and commanding brow--I recognized the Countess of Windsor.
With a hollow voice she asked, "Where is the princess"?
I pointed to the torn up pavement: she walked to the spot, and looked down into the palpable darkness; for the vault was too distant for the rays of the small lamp I had left there to be discernible.
"Your light," she said.
I gave it her; and she regarded the now visible, but precipitous steps, as if calculating her capacity to descend.
Instinctively I made a silent offer of my assistance.
She motioned me away with a look of scorn, saying in an harsh voice, as she pointed downwards, "There at least I may have her undisturbed".
She walked deliberately down, while I, overcome, miserable beyond words, or tears, or groans, threw myself on the pavement near--the stiffening form of Idris was before me, the death-struck countenance hushed in eternal repose beneath.
That was to me the end of all!
The day before, I had figured to my self various adventures, and communion with my friends in after time--now I had leapt the interval, and reached the utmost edge and bourne of life.
Thus wrapt in gloom, enclosed, walled up, vaulted over by the omnipotent present, I was startled by the sound of feet on the steps of the tomb, and I remembered her whom I had utterly forgotten, my angry visitant; her tall form slowly rose upwards from the
This name, applied at such a moment by my angel's mother, instilled into me more respect than I had ever before felt for this disdainful lady.
I bowed my head, and kissed her shrivelled hand, and, remarking that she trembled violently, supported her to the end of the chancel, where she sat on the steps that led to the regal stall.
She suffered herself to be led, and still holding my hand, she leaned her head back against the stall, while the moon beams, tinged with various colours by the painted glass, fell on her glistening eyes; aware of her weakness, again calling to mind her
No harsh feeling ever clouded her serene brow; how did I treat her?
wounding her gentle heart with savage coldness; I had no compassion on her in past years, does she forgive me now?
Little, little does it boot to talk of repentance and forgiveness to the dead, had I during her life once consulted her gentle wishes, and curbed my rugged nature to do her pleasure, I should not feel thus".
Idris and her mother were unlike in person.
The dark hair, deep-set black eyes, and prominent features of the Ex-Queen were in entire contrast to the golden tresses, the full blue orbs, and the soft lines and contour of her daughter's countenance.
Yet, in latter days, illness had taken from my poor girl the full outline of her face, and reduced it to the inflexible shape of the bone beneath.
In the form of her brow, in her oval chin, there was to be found a resemblance to her mother; nay in some moods, their gestures were not unlike; nor, having lived so long together, was this wonderful.
There is a magic power in resemblance.
When one we love dies, we hope to see them in another state, and half expect that the agency of mind will inform its new garb in imitation of its decayed earthly vesture.
But these are ideas of the mind only.
We know that the instrument is shivered, the sensible image lies in miserable fragments, dissolved to dusty nothingness; a look, a gesture, or a fashioning of the limbs similar to the dead in a living person, touches a thrilling chord, whose sacred harmony
Strangely moved, prostrate before this spectral image, and enslaved by the force of blood manifested in likeness of look and movement, I remained trembling in the presence of the harsh, proud, and till now unloved mother of Idris.
Poor, mistaken woman!
in her tenderest mood before, she had cherished the idea, that a word, a look of reconciliation from her, would be received with joy, and repay long years of severity.
Now that the time was gone for the exercise of such power, she fell at once upon the thorny truth of things, and felt that neither smile nor caress could penetrate to the unconscious state, or influence the happiness of her who lay in the vault beneath.
This conviction, together with the remembrance of soft replies to bitter speeches, of gentle looks repaying angry glances; the perception of the falsehood, paltryness and futility of her cherished dreams of birth and power; the overpowering knowledge, that
It fell to my lot, to come as the influential power, to allay the fierce tossing of these tumultuous waves.
I spoke to her; I led her to reflect how happy Idris had really been, and how her virtues and numerous excellencies had found scope and estimation in her past career.
I praised her, the idol of my heart's dear worship, the admired type of feminine perfection.
With ardent and overflowing eloquence, I relieved my heart from its burthen, and awoke to the sense of a new pleasure in life, as I poured forth the funeral eulogy.
Then I referred to Adrian, her loved brother, and to her surviving child.
I declared, which I had before almost forgotten, what my duties were with regard to these valued portions of herself, and bade the melancholy repentant mother reflect, how she could best expiate unkindness towards the dead, by redoubled love of the
Consoling her, my own sorrows were assuaged; my sincerity won her entire conviction.
She turned to me.
The hard, inflexible, persecuting woman, turned with a mild expression of face, and said, "If our beloved angel sees us now, it will delight her to find that I do you even tardy justice.
You were worthy of her; and from my heart I am glad that you won her away from me.
Pardon, my son, the many wrongs I have done you; forget my bitter words and unkind treatment--take me, and govern me as you will".
I seized this docile moment to propose our departure from the church.
"First," she said, "let us replace the pavement above the vault".
We drew near to it; "Shall we look on her again"?
I asked.
"I cannot," she replied, "and, I pray you, neither do you.
We need not torture ourselves by gazing on the soulless body, while her living spirit is buried quick in our hearts, and her surpassing loveliness is so deeply carved there, that sleeping or waking she must ever be present to us".
For a few moments, we bent in solemn silence over the open vault.
I consecrated my future life, to the embalming of her dear memory; I vowed to serve her brother and her child till death.
The convulsive sob of my companion made me break off my internal orisons.
I next dragged the stones over the entrance of the tomb, and closed the gulph that contained the life of my life.
Then, supporting my decrepid fellow-mourner, we slowly left the chapel.
I felt, as I stepped into the open air, as if I had quitted an happy nest of repose, for a dreary wilderness, a tortuous path, a bitter, joyless, hopeless pilgrimage.
CHAPTER IV.
OUR escort had been directed to prepare our abode for the night at the inn, opposite the ascent to the Castle.
We could not again visit the halls and familiar chambers of our home, on a mere visit.
We had already left for ever the glades of Windsor, and all of coppice, flowery hedgerow, and murmuring stream, which gave shape and intensity to the love of our country, and the almost superstitious attachment with which we regarded native England.
It had been our intention to have called at Lucy's dwelling in Datchet, and to have re-assured her with promises of aid and protection before we repaired to our quarters for the night.
Now, as the Countess of Windsor and I turned down the steep hill that led from the Castle, we saw the children, who had just stopped in their caravan, at the inn-door.
They had passed through Datchet without halting.
I dreaded to meet them, and to be the bearer of my tragic story, so while they were still occupied in the hurry of arrival, I suddenly left them, and through the snow and clear moon-light air, hastened along the well known road to Datchet.
Well known indeed it was.
Each cottage stood on its accustomed site, each tree wore its familiar appearance.
Habit had graven uneraseably on my memory, every turn and change of object on the road.
At a short distance beyond the Little Park, was an elm half blown down by a storm, some ten years ago; and still, with leafless snow-laden branches, it stretched across the pathway, which wound through a meadow, beside a shallow brook, whose brawling was
England remained, though England was dead--it was the ghost of merry England that I beheld, under those greenwood shade passing generations had sported in security and ease.
To this painful recognition of familiar places, was added a feeling experienced by all, understood by none--a feeling as if in some state, less visionary than a dream, in some past real existence, I had seen all I saw, with precisely the same feelings as I
To get rid of this oppressive sense I strove to imagine change in this tranquil spot--this augmented my mood, by causing me to bestow more attention on the objects which occasioned me pain.
I reached Datchet and Lucy's humble abode--once noisy with Saturday night revellers, or trim and neat on Sunday morning it had borne testimony to the labours and orderly habits of the housewife.
The snow lay high about the door, as if it had remained unclosed for many days.
"What scene of death hath Roscius now to act"?
I muttered to myself as I looked at the dark casements.
At first I thought I saw a light in one of them, but it proved to be merely the refraction of the moon-beams, while the only sound was the crackling branches as the breeze whirred the snow flakes from them--the moon sailed high and unclouded in the
I entered this by the open wicket, and anxiously examined each window.
At length I detected a ray of light struggling through a closed shutter in one of the upper rooms--it was a novel feeling, alas!
to look at any house and say there dwells its usual inmate--the door of the house was merely on the latch: so I entered and ascended the moon-lit staircase.
The door of the inhabited room was ajar: looking in, I saw Lucy sitting as at work at the table on which the light stood; the implements of needlework were about her, but her hand had fallen on her lap, and her eyes, fixed on the ground, shewed by their
Traces of care and watching had diminished her former attractions--but her simple dress and cap, her desponding attitude, and the single candle that cast its light upon her, gave for a moment a picturesque grouping to the whole.
A fearful reality recalled me from the thought--a figure lay stretched on the bed covered by a sheet--her mother was dead, and Lucy, apart from all the world, deserted and alone, watched beside the corpse during the weary night.
I entered the room, and my unexpected appearance at first drew a scream from the lone survivor of a dead nation; but she recognised me, and recovered herself, with the quick exercise of self-control habitual to her.
"Did you not expect me"?
I asked, in that low voice which the presence of the dead makes us as it were instinctively assume.
"You are very good," replied she, "to have come yourself; I can never thank you sufficiently; but it is too late".
"Too late," cried I, "what do you mean?
It is not too late to take you from this deserted place, and conduct you to---" My own loss, which I had forgotten as I spoke, now made me turn away, while choking grief impeded my speech.
I threw open the window, and looked on the cold, waning, ghastly, misshaped circle on high, and the chill white earth beneath--did the spirit of sweet Idris sail along the moon-frozen crystal air?
--No, no, a more genial atmosphere, a lovelier habitation was surely hers!
I indulged in this meditation for a moment, and then again addressed the mourner, who stood leaning against the bed with that expression of resigned despair, of complete misery, and a patient sufferance of it, which is far more touching than any of the
I desired to draw her from this spot; but she opposed my wish.
That class of persons whose imagination and sensibility have never been taken out of the narrow circle immediately in view, if they possess these qualities to any extent, are apt to pour their influence into the very realities which appear to destroy them,
Thus Lucy, in desert England, in a dead world, wished to fulfil the usual ceremonies of the dead, such as were customary to the English country people, when death was a rare visitant, and gave us time to receive his dreaded usurpation with pomp and
She had already, alone as she was, accomplished some of these, and the work on which I found her employed, was her mother's shroud.
My heart sickened at such detail of woe, which a female can endure, but which is more painful to the masculine spirit than deadliest struggle, or throes of unutterable but transient agony.
This must not be, I told her; and then, as further inducement, I communicated to her my recent loss, and gave her the idea that she must come with me to take charge of the orphan children, whom the death of Idris had deprived of a mother's care.
Lucy never resisted the call of a duty, so she yielded, and closing the casements and doors with care, she accompanied me back to Windsor.
As we went she communicated to me the occasion of her mother's death.
Either by some mischance she had got sight of Lucy's letter to Idris, or she had overheard her conversation with the countryman who bore it; however it might be, she obtained a knowledge of the appalling situation of herself and her daughter, her aged
Her life, which had long been hovering on its extinction, now yielded at once to the united effects of misery and sickness, and that same morning she had died.
After the tumultuous emotions of the day, I was glad to find on my arrival at the inn that my companions had retired to rest.
I gave Lucy in charge to the Countess's attendant, and then sought repose from my various struggles and impatient regrets.
For a few moments the events of the day floated in disastrous pageant through my brain, till sleep bathed it in forgetfulness; when morning dawned and I awoke, it seemed as if my slumber had endured for years.
My companions had not shared my oblivion.
Clara's swollen eyes shewed that she has passed the night in weeping.
The Countess looked haggard and wan.
Her firm spirit had not found relief in tears, and she suffered the more from all the painful retrospect and agonizing regret that now occupied her.
We departed from Windsor, as soon as the burial rites had been performed for Lucy's mother, and, urged on by an impatient desire to change the scene, went forward towards Dover with speed, our escort having gone before to provide horses; finding them
During our ride the Countess recounted to me the extraordinary circumstances which had brought her so strangely to my side in the chancel of St. George's chapel.
When last she had taken leave of Idris, as she looked anxiously on her faded person and pallid countenance, she had suddenly been visited by a conviction that she saw her for the last time.
It was hard to part with her while under the dominion of this sentiment, and for the last time she endeavoured to persuade her daughter to commit herself to her nursing, permitting me to join Adrian.
Idris mildly refused, and thus they separated.
The idea that they should never again meet grew on the Countess's mind, and haunted her perpetually; a thousand times she had resolved to turn back and join us, and was again and again restrained by the pride and anger of which she was the slave.
Proud of heart as she was, she bathed her pillow with nightly tears, and through the day was subdued by nervous agitation and expectation of the dreaded event, which she was wholly incapable of curbing.
She confessed that at this period her hatred of me knew no bounds, since she considered me as the sole obstacle to the fulfilment of her dearest wish, that of attending upon her daughter in her last moments.
She desired to express her fears to her son, and to seek consolation from his sympathy with, or courage from his rejection of, her auguries.
On the first day of her arrival at Dover she walked with him on the sea beach, and with the timidity characteristic of passionate and exaggerated feeling was by degrees bringing the conversation to the desired point, when she could communicate her fears to
He gave some oral account of how he had left us, and added, that notwithstanding the cheerfulness and good courage of Lady Idris, he was afraid that she would hardly reach Windsor alive.
"True," said the Countess, "your fears are just, she is about to expire"!
As she spoke, her eyes were fixed on a tomblike hollow of the cliff, and she saw, she averred the same to me with solemnity, Idris pacing slowly towards this cave.
She was turned from her, her head was bent down, her white dress was such as she was accustomed to wear, except that a thin crape-like veil covered her golden tresses, and concealed her as a dim transparent mist.
She looked dejected, as docilely yielding to a commanding power; she submissively entered, and was lost in the dark recess.
"Were I subject to visionary moods," said the venerable lady, as she continued her narrative, "I might doubt my eyes, and condemn my credulity; but reality is the world I live in, and what I saw I doubt not had existence beyond myself.
From that moment I could not rest; it was worth my existence to see her once again before she died; I knew that I should not accomplish this, yet I must endeavour.
I immediately departed for Windsor; and, though I was assured that we travelled speedily, it seemed to me that our progress was snail-like, and that delays were created solely for my annoyance.
Still I accused you, and heaped on your head the fiery ashes of my burning impatience.
It was no disappointment, though an agonizing pang, when you pointed to her last abode; and words would ill express the abhorrence I that moment felt towards you, the triumphant impediment to my dearest wishes.
I saw her, and anger, and hate, and injustice died at her bier, giving place at their departure to a remorse (Great God, that I should feel it!
) which must last while memory and feeling endure".
To medicine such remorse, to prevent awakening love and new-born mildness from producing the same bitter fruit that hate and harshness had done, I devoted all my endeavours to soothe the venerable penitent.
Our party was a melancholy one; each was possessed by regret for what was remediless; for the absence of his mother shadowed even the infant gaiety of Evelyn.
Added to this was the prospect of the uncertain future.
Before the final accomplishment of any great voluntary change the mind vacillates, now soothing itself by fervent expectation, now recoiling from obstacles which seem never to have presented themselves before with so frightful an aspect.
An involuntary tremor ran through me when I thought that in another day we might have crossed the watery barrier, and have set forward on that hopeless, interminable, sad wandering, which but a short time before I regarded as the only relief to sorrow that
Our approach to Dover was announced by the loud roarings of the wintry sea.
They were borne miles inland by the sound-laden blast, and by their unaccustomed uproar, imparted a feeling of insecurity and peril to our stable abode.
At first we hardly permitted ourselves to think that any unusual eruption of nature caused this tremendous war of air and water, but rather fancied that we merely listened to what we had heard a thousand times before, when we had watched the flocks of
But we found upon advancing farther, that Dover was overflowed-- many of the houses were overthrown by the surges which filled the streets, and with hideous brawlings sometimes retreated leaving the pavement of the town bare, till again hurried forward by
Hardly less disturbed than the tempestuous world of waters was the assembly of human beings, that from the cliff fearfully watched its ravings.
On the morning of the arrival of the emigrants under the conduct of Adrian, the sea had been serene and glassy, the slight ripples refracted the sunbeams, which shed their radiance through the clear blue frosty air.
This placid appearance of nature was hailed as a good augury for the voyage, and the chief immediately repaired to the harbour to examine two steamboats which were moored there.
On the following midnight, when all were at rest, a frightful storm of wind and clattering rain and hail first disturbed them, and the voice of one shrieking in the streets, that the sleepers must awake or they would be drowned; and when they rushed out,
They ascended the cliff, but the darkness permitted only the white crest of waves to be seen, while the roaring wind mingled its howlings in dire accord with the wild surges.
The awful hour of night, the utter inexperience of many who had never seen the sea before, the wailing of women and cries of children added to the horror of the tumult.
All the following day the same scene continued.
When the tide ebbed, the town was left dry; but on its flow, it rose even higher than on the preceding night.
The vast ships that lay rotting in the roads were whirled from their anchorage, and driven and jammed against the cliff, the vessels in the harbour were flung on land like sea-weed, and there battered to pieces by the breakers.
The waves dashed against the cliff, which if in any place it had been before loosened, now gave way, and the affrighted crowd saw vast fragments of the near earth fall with crash and roar into the deep.
This sight operated differently on different persons.
The greater part thought it a judgment of God, to prevent or punish our emigration from our native land.
Many were doubly eager to quit a nook of ground now become their prison, which appeared unable to resist the inroads of ocean's giant waves.
When we arrived at Dover, after a fatiguing day's journey, we all required rest and sleep; but the scene acting around us soon drove away such ideas.
We were drawn, along with the greater part of our companions, to the edge of the cliff, there to listen to and make a thousand conjectures.
A fog narrowed our horizon to about a quarter of a mile, and the misty veil, cold and dense, enveloped sky and sea in equal obscurity.
What added to our inquietude was the circumstance that two-thirds of our original number were now waiting for us in Paris, and clinging, as we now did most painfully, to any addition to our melancholy remnant, this division, with the tameless impassable
At length, after loitering for several hours on the cliff, we retired to Dover Castle, whose roof sheltered all who breathed the English air, and sought the sleep necessary to restore strength and courage to our worn frames and languid spirits.
Early in the morning Adrian brought me the welcome intelligence that the wind had changed: it had been south-west; it was now north-east.
The sky was stripped bare of clouds by the increasing gale, while the tide at its ebb seceded entirely from the town.
The change of wind rather increased the fury of the sea, but it altered its late dusky hue to a bright green; and in spite of its unmitigated clamour, its more cheerful appearance instilled hope and pleasure.
All day we watched the ranging of the mountainous waves, and towards sunset a desire to decypher the promise for the morrow at its setting, made us all gather with one accord on the edge of the cliff.
When the mighty luminary approached within a few degrees of the tempest-tossed horizon, suddenly, a wonder!
three other suns, alike burning and brilliant, rushed from various quarters of the heavens towards the great orb; they whirled round it.
The glare of light was intense to our dazzled eyes; the sun itself seemed to join in the dance, while the sea burned like a furnace, like all Vesuvius a-light, with flowing lava beneath.
The horses broke loose from their stalls in terror--a herd of cattle, panic struck, raced down to the brink of the cliff, and blinded by light, plunged down with frightful yells in the waves below.
The time occupied by the apparition of these meteors was comparatively short; suddenly the three mock suns united in one, and plunged into the sea.
A few seconds afterwards, a deafening watery sound came up with awful peal from the spot where they had disappeared.
Meanwhile the sun, disencumbered from his strange satellites, paced with its accustomed majesty towards its western home.
When--we dared not trust our eyes late dazzled, but it seemed that--the sea rose to meet it--it mounted higher and higher, till the fiery globe was obscured, and the wall of water still ascended the horizon; it appeared as if suddenly the motion of earth
Many cried aloud, that these were no meteors, but globes of burning matter, which had set fire to the earth, and caused the vast cauldron at our feet to bubble up with its measureless waves; the day of judgment was come they averred, and a few moments
In support of this opinion they pointed out the fact that the east wind died away, while the rushing of the coming west mingled its wild howl with the roar of the advancing waters.
Would the cliff resist this new battery?
Was not the giant wave far higher than the precipice?
Would not our little island be deluged by its approach?
The crowd of spectators fled.
They were dispersed over the fields, stopping now and then, and looking back in terror.
A sublime sense of awe calmed the swift pulsations of my heart--I awaited the approach of the destruction menaced, with that solemn resignation which an unavoidable necessity instils.
The ocean every moment assumed a more terrific aspect, while the twilight was dimmed by the rack which the west wind spread over the sky.
By slow degrees however, as the wave advanced, it took a more mild appearance; some under current of air, or obstruction in the bed of the waters, checked its progress, and it sank gradually; while the surface of the sea became uniformly higher as it
This change took from us the fear of an immediate catastrophe, although we were still anxious as to the final result.
We continued during the whole night to watch the fury of the sea and the pace of the driving clouds, through whose openings the rare stars rushed impetuously; the thunder of conflicting elements deprived us of all power to sleep.
This endured ceaselessly for three days and nights.
The stoutest hearts quailed before the savage enmity of nature; provisions began to fail us, though every day foraging parties were dispersed to the nearer towns.
In vain we schooled ourselves into the belief, that there was nothing out of the common order of nature in the strife we witnessed; our disasterous and overwhelming destiny turned the best of us to cowards.
Death had hunted us through the course of many months, even to the narrow strip of time on which we now stood; narrow indeed, and buffeted by storms, was our footway overhanging the great sea of calamity-- As an unsheltered northern shore Is shaken by the
[1] It required more than human energy to bear up against the menaces of destruction that every where surrounded us.
After the lapse of three days, the gale died away, the sea-gull sailed upon the calm bosom of the windless atmosphere, and the last yellow leaf on the topmost branch of the oak hung without motion.
The sea no longer broke with fury; but a swell setting in steadily for shore, with long sweep and sullen burst replaced the roar of the breakers.
Yet we derived hope from the change, and we did not doubt that after the interval of a few days the sea would resume its tranquillity.
The sunset of the fourth day favoured this idea; it was clear and golden.
As we gazed on the purple sea, radiant beneath, we were attracted by a novel spectacle; a dark speck--as it neared, visibly a boat--rode on the top of the waves, every now and then lost in the steep vallies between.
We marked its course with eager questionings; and, when we saw that it evidently made for shore, we descended to the only practicable landing place, and hoisted a signal to direct them.
By the help of glasses we distinguished her crew; it consisted of nine men, Englishmen, belonging in truth to the two divisions of our people, who had preceded us, and had been for several weeks at Paris.
As countryman was wont to meet countryman in distant lands, did we greet our visitors on their landing, with outstretched hands and gladsome welcome.
They were slow to reciprocate our gratulations.
They looked angry and resentful; not less than the chafed sea which they had traversed with imminent peril, though apparently more displeased with each other than with us.
It was strange to see these human beings, who appeared to be given forth by the earth like rare and inestimable plants, full of towering passion, and the spirit of angry contest.
Their first demand was to be conducted to the Lord Protector of England, so they called Adrian, though he had long discarded the empty title, as a bitter mockery of the shadow to which the Protectorship was now reduced.
They were speedily led to Dover Castle, from whose keep Adrian had watched the movements of the boat.
He received them with the interest and wonder so strange a visitation created.
In the confusion occasioned by their angry demands for precedence, it was long before we could discover the secret meaning of this strange scene.
By degrees, from the furious declamations of one, the fierce interruptions of another, and the bitter scoffs of a third, we found that they were deputies from our colony at Paris, from three parties there formed, who, each with angry rivalry, tried to
These deputies had been dispatched by them to Adrian, who had been selected arbiter; and they had journied from Paris to Calais, through the vacant towns and desolate country, indulging the while violent hatred against each other; and now they pleaded
By examining the deputies apart, and after much investigation, we learnt the true state of things at Paris.
Since parliament had elected him Ryland's deputy, all the surviving English had submitted to Adrian.
He was our captain to lead us from our native soil to unknown lands, our lawgiver and our preserver.
On the first arrangement of our scheme of emigration, no continued separation of our members was contemplated, and the command of the whole body in gradual ascent of power had its apex in the Earl of Windsor.
But unforeseen circumstances changed our plans for us, and occasioned the greater part of our numbers to be divided for the space of nearly two months, from the supreme chief.
They had gone over in two distinct bodies; and on their arrival at Paris dissension arose between them.
They had found Paris a desert.
When first the plague had appeared, the return of travellers and merchants, and communications by letter, informed us regularly of the ravages made by disease on the continent.
But with the encreased mortality this intercourse declined and ceased.
Even in England itself communication from one part of the island to the other became slow and rare.
No vessel stemmed the flood that divided Calais from Dover; or if some melancholy voyager, wishing to assure himself of the life or death of his relatives, put from the French shore to return among us, often the greedy ocean swallowed his little craft, or
We were therefore to a great degree ignorant of the state of things on the continent, and were not without some vague hope of finding numerous companions in its wide track.
But the same causes that had so fearfully diminished the English nation had had even greater scope for mischief in the sister land.
France was a blank; during the long line of road from Calais to Paris not one human being was found.
In Paris there were a few, perhaps a hundred, who, resigned to their coming fate, flitted about the streets of the capital and assembled to converse of past times, with that vivacity and even gaiety that seldom deserts the individuals of this nation.
The English took uncontested possession of Paris.
Its high houses and narrow streets were lifeless.
A few pale figures were to be distinguished at the accustomed resort at the Tuileries; they wondered wherefore the islanders should approach their ill-fated city--for in the excess of wretchedness, the sufferers always imagine, that their part of the
They listened to the account the emigrants gave of their motives for leaving their native land, with a shrug almost of disdain--"Return," they said, "return to your island, whose sea breezes, and division from the continent gives some promise of health; if
Are you not even now more numerous than we are?
--A year ago you would have found only the sick burying the dead; now we are happier; for the pang of struggle has passed away, and the few you find here are patiently waiting the final blow.
But you, who are not content to die, breathe no longer the air of France, or soon you will only be a part of her soil".
Thus, by menaces of the sword, they would have driven back those who had escaped from fire.
But the peril left behind was deemed imminent by my countrymen; that before them doubtful and distant; and soon other feelings arose to obliterate fear, or to replace it by passions, that ought to have had no place among a brotherhood of unhappy survivors
The more numerous division of emigrants, which arrived first at Paris, assumed a superiority of rank and power; the second party asserted their independence.
A third was formed by a sectarian, a self-erected prophet, who, while he attributed all power and rule to God, strove to get the real command of his comrades into his own hands.
This third division consisted of fewest individuals, but their purpose was more one, their obedience to their leader more entire, their fortitude and courage more unyielding and active.
During the whole progress of the plague, the teachers of religion were in possession of great power; a power of good, if rightly directed, or of incalculable mischief, if fanaticism or intolerance guided their efforts.
In the present instance, a worse feeling than either of these actuated the leader.
He was an impostor in the most determined sense of the term.
A man who had in early life lost, through the indulgence of vicious propensities, all sense of rectitude or self-esteem; and who, when ambition was awakened in him, gave himself up to its influence unbridled by any scruple.
His father had been a methodist preacher, an enthusiastic man with simple intentions; but whose pernicious doctrines of election and special grace had contributed to destroy all conscientious feeling in his son.
During the progress of the pestilence he had entered upon various schemes, by which to acquire adherents and power.
Adrian had discovered and defeated these attempts; but Adrian was absent; the wolf assumed the shepherd's garb, and the flock admitted the deception: he had formed a party during the few weeks he had been in Paris, who zealously propagated the creed of his
When once the spirit of dissension had arisen, the most frivolous causes gave it activity.
The first party, on arriving at Paris, had taken possession of the Tuileries; chance and friendly feeling had induced the second to lodge near to them.
A contest arose concerning the distribution of the pillage; the chiefs of the first division demanded that the whole should be placed at their disposal; with this assumption the opposite party refused to comply.
When next the latter went to forage, the gates of Paris were shut on them.
After overcoming this difficulty, they marched in a body to the Tuileries.
They found that their enemies had been already expelled thence by the Elect, as the fanatical party designated themselves, who refused to admit any into the palace who did not first abjure obedience to all except God, and his delegate on earth, their
Such was the beginning of the strife, which at length proceeded so far, that the three divisions, armed, met in the Place Vendome, each resolved to subdue by force the resistance of its adversaries.
They assembled, their muskets were loaded, and even pointed at the breasts of their so called enemies.
One word had been sufficient; and there the last of mankind would have burthened their souls with the crime of murder, and dipt their hands in each other's blood.
A sense of shame, a recollection that not only their cause, but the existence of the whole human race was at stake, entered the breast of the leader of the more numerous party.
He was aware, that if the ranks were thinned, no other recruits could fill them up; that each man was as a priceless gem in a kingly crown, which if destroyed, the earth's deep entrails could yield no paragon.
He was a young man, and had been hurried on by presumption, and the notion of his high rank and superiority to all other pretenders; now he repented his work, he felt that all the blood about to be shed would be on his head; with sudden impulse therefore
He spoke with warmth; he reminded them of the oath all the chiefs had taken to submit to the Lord Protector; he declared their present meeting to be an act of treason and mutiny; he allowed that he had been hurried away by passion, but that a cooler moment
His offer was accepted so far, that each leader consented to command a retreat, and moreover agreed, that after the approbation of their several parties had been consulted, they should meet that night on some neutral spot to ratify the truce.
At the meeting of the chiefs, this plan was finally concluded upon.
The leader of the fanatics indeed refused to admit the arbitration of Adrian; he sent ambassadors, rather than deputies, to assert his claim, not plead his cause.
The truce was to continue until the first of February, when the bands were again to assemble on the Place Vendome; it was of the utmost consequence therefore that Adrian should arrive in Paris by that day, since an hair might turn the scale, and peace,
It was now the twenty-eighth of January; every vessel stationed near Dover had been beaten to pieces and destroyed by the furious storms I have commemorated.
Our journey however would admit of no delay.
That very night, Adrian, and I, and twelve others, either friends or attendants, put off from the English shore, in the boat that had brought over the deputies.
We all took our turn at the oar; and the immediate occasion of our departure affording us abundant matter for conjecture and discourse, prevented the feeling that we left our native country, depopulate England, for the last time, to enter deeply into the
It was a serene starlight night, and the dark line of the English coast continued for some time visible at intervals, as we rose on the broad back of the waves.
I exerted myself with my long oar to give swift impulse to our skiff; and, while the waters splashed with melancholy sound against its sides, I looked with sad affection on this last glimpse of sea-girt England, and strained my eyes not too soon to lose
A solitary sea-gull winged its flight over our heads, to seek its nest in a cleft of the precipice.
Yes, thou shalt revisit the land of thy birth, I thought, as I looked invidiously on the airy voyager; but we shall, never more!
Tomb of Idris, farewell!
Grave, in which my heart lies sepultured, farewell for ever!
We were twelve hours at sea, and the heavy swell obliged us to exert all our strength.
At length, by mere dint of rowing, we reached the French coast.
The stars faded, and the grey morning cast a dim veil over the silver horns of the waning moon--the sun rose broad and red from the sea, as we walked over the sands to Calais.
Our first care was to procure horses, and although wearied by our night of watching and toil, some of our party immediately went in quest of these in the wide fields of the unenclosed and now barren plain round Calais.
We divided ourselves, like seamen, into watches, and some reposed, while others prepared the morning's repast.
Our foragers returned at noon with only six horses--on these, Adrian and I, and four others, proceeded on our journey towards the great city, which its inhabitants had fondly named the capital of the civilized world.
Our horses had become, through their long holiday, almost wild, and we crossed the plain round Calais with impetuous speed.
From the height near Boulogne, I turned again to look on England; nature had cast a misty pall over her, her cliff was hidden--there was spread the watery barrier that divided us, never again to be crossed; she lay on the ocean plain, In the great pool a
Ruined the nest, alas!
the swans of Albion had passed away for ever--an uninhabited rock in the wide Pacific, which had remained since the creation uninhabited, unnamed, unmarked, would be of as much account in the world's future history, as desert England.
Our journey was impeded by a thousand obstacles.
As our horses grew tired, we had to seek for others; and hours were wasted, while we exhausted our artifices to allure some of these enfranchised slaves of man to resume the yoke; or as we went from stable to stable through the towns, hoping to find some
Our ill success in procuring them, obliged us continually to leave some one of our companions behind; and on the first of February, Adrian and I entered Paris, wholly unaccompanied.
The serene morning had dawned when we arrived at Saint Denis, and the sun was high, when the clamour of voices, and the clash, as we feared, of weapons, guided us to where our countrymen had assembled on the Place Vendome.
We passed a knot of Frenchmen, who were talking earnestly of the madness of the insular invaders, and then coming by a sudden turn upon the Place, we saw the sun glitter on drawn swords and fixed bayonets, while yells and clamours rent the air.
It was a scene of unaccustomed confusion in these days of depopulation.
Roused by fancied wrongs, and insulting scoffs, the opposite parties had rushed to attack each other; while the elect, drawn up apart, seemed to wait an opportunity to fall with better advantage on their foes, when they should have mutually weakened each
A merciful power interposed, and no blood was shed; for, while the insane mob were in the very act of attack, the females, wives, mothers and daughters, rushed between; they seized the bridles; they embraced the knees of the horsemen, and hung on the
Our voices could not be heard in the tumult; Adrian however was eminent for the white charger he rode; spurring him, he dashed into the midst of the throng: he was recognized, and a loud cry raised for England and the Protector.
The late adversaries, warmed to affection at the sight of him, joined in heedless confusion, and surrounded him; the women kissed his hands, and the edges of his garments; nay, his horse received tribute of their embraces; some wept their welcome; he
His voice was at length heard, and obeyed; the crowd fell back; the chiefs alone rallied round him.
I had seen Lord Raymond ride through his lines; his look of victory, and majestic mien obtained the respect and obedience of all: such was not the appearance or influence of Adrian.
His slight figure, his fervent look, his gesture, more of deprecation than rule, were proofs that love, unmingled with fear, gave him dominion over the hearts of a multitude, who knew that he never flinched from danger, nor was actuated by other motives
No distinction was now visible between the two parties, late ready to shed each other's blood, for, though neither would submit to the other, they both yielded ready obedience to the Earl of Windsor.
One party however remained, cut off from the rest, which did not sympathize in the joy exhibited on Adrian's arrival, or imbibe the spirit of peace, which fell like dew upon the softened hearts of their countrymen.
At the head of this assembly was a ponderous, dark-looking man, whose malign eye surveyed with gloating delight the stern looks of his followers.
They had hitherto been inactive, but now, perceiving themselves to be forgotten in the universal jubilee, they advanced with threatening gestures: our friends had, as it were in wanton contention, attacked each other; they wanted but to be told that their
The first advance of the little army of the elect reawakened their rage; they grasped their arms, and waited but their leader's signal to commence the attack, when the clear tones of Adrian's voice were heard, commanding them to fall back; with confused
Adrian rode singly into the space between the opposing bands; he approached the hostile leader, as requesting him to imitate his example, but his look was not obeyed, and the chief advanced, followed by his whole troop.
There were many women among them, who seemed more eager and resolute than their male companions.
They pressed round their leader, as if to shield him, while they loudly bestowed on him every sacred denomination and epithet of worship.
Adrian met them half way; they halted: "What," he said, "do you seek?
Do you require any thing of us that we refuse to give, and that you are forced to acquire by arms and warfare"?
His questions were answered by a general cry, in which the words election, sin, and red right arm of God, could alone be heard.
Adrian looked expressly at their leader, saying, "Can you not silence your followers?
Mine, you perceive, obey me".
The fellow answered by a scowl; and then, perhaps fearful that his people should become auditors of the debate he expected to ensue, he commanded them to fall back, and advanced by himself.
"What, I again ask," said Adrian, "do you require of us"?
"Repentance," replied the man, whose sinister brow gathered clouds as he spoke.
"Obedience to the will of the Most High, made manifest to these his Elected People.
Do we not all die through your sins, O generation of unbelief, and have we not a right to demand of you repentance and obedience"?
"And if we refuse them, what then"?
his opponent inquired mildly.
"Beware," cried the man, "God hears you, and will smite your stony heart in his wrath; his poisoned arrows fly, his dogs of death are unleashed!
We will not perish unrevenged--and mighty will our avenger be, when he descends in visible majesty, and scatters destruction among you".
"My good fellow," said Adrian, with quiet scorn, "I wish that you were ignorant only, and I think it would be no difficult task to prove to you, that you speak of what you do not understand.
On the present occasion however, it is enough for me to know that you seek nothing of us; and, heaven is our witness, we seek nothing of you.
I should be sorry to embitter by strife the few days that we any of us may have here to live; when there," he pointed downwards, "we shall not be able to contend, while here we need not.
Go home, or stay; pray to your God in your own mode; your friends may do the like.
My orisons consist in peace and good will, in resignation and hope.
Farewell"!
He bowed slightly to the angry disputant who was about to reply; and, turning his horse down Rue Saint Honore, called on his friends to follow him.
He rode slowly, to give time to all to join him at the Barrier, and then issued his orders that those who yielded obedience to him, should rendezvous at Versailles.
In the meantime he remained within the walls of Paris, until he had secured the safe retreat of all.
In about a fortnight the remainder of the emigrants arrived from England, and they all repaired to Versailles; apartments were prepared for the family of the Protector in the Grand Trianon, and there, after the excitement of these events, we reposed amidst
[1] Chorus in Oedipus Coloneus.
CHAPTER V. AFTER the repose of a few days, we held a council, to decide on our future movements.
Our first plan had been to quit our wintry native latitude, and seek for our diminished numbers the luxuries and delights of a southern climate.
We had not fixed on any precise spot as the termination of our wanderings; but a vague picture of perpetual spring, fragrant groves, and sparkling streams, floated in our imagination to entice us on.
A variety of causes had detained us in England, and we had now arrived at the middle of February; if we pursued our original project, we should find ourselves in a worse situation than before, having exchanged our temperate climate for the intolerable
We were therefore obliged to modify our plan, as the season continued to be inclement; and it was determined that we should await the arrival of spring in our present abode, and so order our future movements as to pass the hot months in the icy vallies of
The castle and town of Versailles afforded our numbers ample accommodation, and foraging parties took it by turns to supply our wants.
There was a strange and appalling motley in the situation of these the last of the race.
At first I likened it to a colony, which borne over the far seas, struck root for the first time in a new country.
But where was the bustle and industry characteristic of such an assemblage; the rudely constructed dwelling, which was to suffice till a more commodious mansion could be built; the marking out of fields; the attempt at cultivation; the eager curiosity to
Our habitations were palaces our food was ready stored in granaries--there was no need of labour, no inquisitiveness, no restless desire to get on.
If we had been assured that we should secure the lives of our present numbers, there would have been more vivacity and hope in our councils.
We should have discussed as to the period when the existing produce for man's sustenance would no longer suffice for us, and what mode of life we should then adopt.
We should have considered more carefully our future plans, and debated concerning the spot where we should in future dwell.
But summer and the plague were near, and we dared not look forward.
Every heart sickened at the thought of amusement; if the younger part of our community were ever impelled, by youthful and untamed hilarity, to enter on any dance or song, to cheer the melancholy time, they would suddenly break off, checked by a mournful
If laughter echoed under our roof, yet the heart was vacant of joy; and, when ever it chanced that I witnessed such attempts at pastime, they encreased instead of diminishing my sense of woe.
In the midst of the pleasure-hunting throng, I would close my eyes, and see before me the obscure cavern, where was garnered the mortality of Idris, and the dead lay around, mouldering in hushed repose.
When I again became aware of the present hour, softest melody of Lydian flute, or harmonious maze of graceful dance, was but as the demoniac chorus in the Wolf's Glen, and the caperings of the reptiles that surrounded the magic circle.
My dearest interval of peace occurred, when, released from the obligation of associating with the crowd, I could repose in the dear home where my children lived.
Children I say, for the tenderest emotions of paternity bound me to Clara.
She was now fourteen; sorrow, and deep insight into the scenes around her, calmed the restless spirit of girlhood; while the remembrance of her father whom she idolized, and respect for me and Adrian, implanted an high sense of duty in her young heart.
Though serious she was not sad; the eager desire that makes us all, when young, plume our wings, and stretch our necks, that we may more swiftly alight tiptoe on the height of maturity, was subdued in her by early experience.
All that she could spare of overflowing love from her parents' memory, and attention to her living relatives, was spent upon religion.
This was the hidden law of her heart, which she concealed with childish reserve, and cherished the more because it was secret.
What faith so entire, what charity so pure, what hope so fervent, as that of early youth?
and she, all love, all tenderness and trust, who from infancy had been tossed on the wide sea of passion and misfortune, saw the finger of apparent divinity in all, and her best hope was to make herself acceptable to the power she worshipped.
Evelyn was only five years old; his joyous heart was incapable of sorrow, and he enlivened our house with the innocent mirth incident to his years.
The aged Countess of Windsor had fallen from her dream of power, rank and grandeur; she had been suddenly seized with the conviction, that love was the only good of life, virtue the only ennobling distinction and enriching wealth.
Such a lesson had been taught her by the dead lips of her neglected daughter; and she devoted herself, with all the fiery violence of her character, to the obtaining the affection of the remnants of her family.
In early years the heart of Adrian had been chilled towards her; and, though he observed a due respect, her coldness, mixed with the recollection of disappointment and madness, caused him to feel even pain in her society.
She saw this, and yet determined to win his love; the obstacle served the rather to excite her ambition.
As Henry, Emperor of Germany, lay in the snow before Pope Leo's gate for three winter days and nights, so did she in humility wait before the icy barriers of his closed heart, till he, the servant of love, and prince of tender courtesy, opened it wide for
Her understanding, courage, and presence of mind, became powerful auxiliaries to him in the difficult task of ruling the tumultuous crowd, which were subjected to his control, in truth by a single hair.
The principal circumstances that disturbed our tranquillity during this interval, originated in the vicinity of the impostor-prophet and his followers.
They continued to reside at Paris; but missionaries from among them often visited Versailles--and such was the power of assertions, however false, yet vehemently iterated, over the ready credulity of the ignorant and fearful, that they seldom failed in
An instance of this nature coming immediately under our notice, we were led to consider the miserable state in which we should leave our countrymen, when we should, at the approach of summer, move on towards Switzerland, and leave a deluded crew behind us
The sense of the smallness of our numbers, and expectation of decrease, pressed upon us; and, while it would be a subject of congratulation to ourselves to add one to our party, it would be doubly gratifying to rescue from the pernicious influence of
If we had considered the preacher as sincere in a belief of his own denunciations, or only moderately actuated by kind feeling in the exercise of his assumed powers, we should have immediately addressed ourselves to him, and endeavoured with our best
But he was instigated by ambition, he desired to rule over these last stragglers from the fold of death; his projects went so far, as to cause him to calculate that, if, from these crushed remains, a few survived, so that a new race should spring up, he,
These ideas made him inflexible in his rule, and violent in his hate of any who presumed to share with him his usurped empire.
It is a strange fact, but incontestible, that the philanthropist, who ardent in his desire to do good, who patient, reasonable and gentle, yet disdains to use other argument than truth, has less influence over men's minds, than he who, grasping and
If this from time immemorial has been the case, the contrast was infinitely greater, now that the one could bring harrowing fears and transcendent hopes into play; while the other had few hopes to hold forth, nor could influence the imagination to diminish
The preacher had persuaded his followers, that their escape from the plague, the salvation of their children, and the rise of a new race of men from their seed, depended on their faith in, and their submission to him.
They greedily imbibed this belief; and their over-weening credulity even rendered them eager to make converts to the same faith.
How to seduce any individuals from such an alliance of fraud, was a frequent subject of Adrian's meditations and discourse.
He formed many plans for the purpose; but his own troop kept him in full occupation to ensure their fidelity and safety; beside which the preacher was as cautious and prudent, as he was cruel.
His victims lived under the strictest rules and laws, which either entirely imprisoned them within the Tuileries, or let them out in such numbers, and under such leaders, as precluded the possibility of controversy.
There was one among them however whom I resolved to save; she had been known to us in happier days; Idris had loved her; and her excellent nature made it peculiarly lamentable that she should be sacrificed by this merciless cannibal of souls.
This man had between two and three hundred persons enlisted under his banners.
More than half of them were women; there were about fifty children of all ages; and not more than eighty men.
They were mostly drawn from that which, when such distinctions existed, was denominated the lower rank of society.
The exceptions consisted of a few high-born females, who, panic-struck, and tamed by sorrow, had joined him.
Among these was one, young, lovely, and enthusiastic, whose very goodness made her a more easy victim.
I have mentioned her before: Juliet, the youngest daughter, and now sole relic of the ducal house of L---.
There are some beings, whom fate seems to select on whom to pour, in unmeasured portion, the vials of her wrath, and whom she bathes even to the lips in misery.
Such a one was the ill-starred Juliet.
She had lost her indulgent parents, her brothers and sisters, companions of her youth; in one fell swoop they had been carried off from her.
Yet she had again dared to call herself happy; united to her admirer, to him who possessed and filled her whole heart, she yielded to the lethean powers of love, and knew and felt only his life and presence.
At the very time when with keen delight she welcomed the tokens of maternity, this sole prop of her life failed, her husband died of the plague.
For a time she had been lulled in insanity; the birth of her child restored her to the cruel reality of things, but gave her at the same time an object for whom to preserve at once life and reason.
Every friend and relative had died off, and she was reduced to solitude and penury; deep melancholy and angry impatience distorted her judgment, so that she could not persuade herself to disclose her distress to us.
When she heard of the plan of universal emigration, she resolved to remain behind with her child, and alone in wide England to live or die, as fate might decree, beside the grave of her beloved.
She had hidden herself in one of the many empty habitations of London; it was she who rescued my Idris on the fatal twentieth of November, though my immediate danger, and the subsequent illness of Idris, caused us to forget our hapless friend.
This circumstance had however brought her again in contact with her fellow-creatures; a slight illness of her infant, proved to her that she was still bound to humanity by an indestructible tie; to preserve this little creature's life became the object of
She became an easy prey to the methodist; her sensibility and acute fears rendered her accessible to every impulse; her love for her child made her eager to cling to the merest straw held out to save him.
Her mind, once unstrung, and now tuned by roughest inharmonious hands, made her credulous: beautiful as fabled goddess, with voice of unrivalled sweetness, burning with new lighted enthusiasm, she became a stedfast proselyte, and powerful auxiliary to the
I had remarked her in the crowd, on the day we met on the Place Vendome; and, recollecting suddenly her providential rescue of my lost one, on the night of the twentieth of November, I reproached myself for my neglect and ingratitude, and felt impelled to
I will not, at this period of my story, record the artifices I used to penetrate the asylum of the Tuileries, or give what would be a tedious account of my stratagems, disappointments, and perseverance.
I at last succeeded in entering these walls, and roamed its halls and corridors in eager hope to find my selected convert.
In the evening I contrived to mingle unobserved with the congregation, which assembled in the chapel to listen to the crafty and eloquent harangue of their prophet.
I saw Juliet near him.
Her dark eyes, fearfully impressed with the restless glare of madness, were fixed on him; she held her infant, not yet a year old, in her arms; and care of it alone could distract her attention from the words to which she eagerly listened.
After the sermon was over, the congregation dispersed; all quitted the chapel except she whom I sought; her babe had fallen asleep; so she placed it on a cushion, and sat on the floor beside, watching its tranquil slumber.
I presented myself to her; for a moment natural feeling produced a sentiment of gladness, which disappeared again, when with ardent and affectionate exhortation I besought her to accompany me in flight from this den of superstition and misery.
In a moment she relapsed into the delirium of fanaticism, and, but that her gentle nature forbade, would have loaded me with execrations.
She conjured me, she commanded me to leave her-- "Beware, O beware," she cried, "fly while yet your escape is practicable.
Now you are safe; but strange sounds and inspirations come on me at times, and if the Eternal should in awful whisper reveal to me his will, that to save my child you must be sacrificed, I would call in the satellites of him you call the tyrant; they would
She spoke hurriedly, with tuneless voice, and wild look; her child awoke, and, frightened, began to cry; each sob went to the ill-fated mother's heart, and she mingled the epithets of endearment she addressed to her infant, with angry commands that I
Had I had the means, I would have risked all, have torn her by force from the murderer's den, and trusted to the healing balm of reason and affection.
But I had no choice, no power even of longer struggle; steps were heard along the gallery, and the voice of the preacher drew near.
Juliet, straining her child in a close embrace, fled by another passage.
Even then I would have followed her; but my foe and his satellites entered; I was surrounded, and taken prisoner.
I remembered the menace of the unhappy Juliet, and expected the full tempest of the man's vengeance, and the awakened wrath of his followers, to fall instantly upon me.
I was questioned.
My answers were simple and sincere.
"His own mouth condemns him," exclaimed the impostor; "he confesses that his intention was to seduce from the way of salvation our well-beloved sister in God; away with him to the dungeon; to-morrow he dies the death; we are manifestly called upon to make
My heart revolted from his hypocritical jargon: but it was unworthy of me to combat in words with the ruffian; and my answer was cool; while, far from being possessed with fear, methought, even at the worst, a man true to himself, courageous and
"Remember," I said, "who I am; and be well assured that I shall not die unavenged.
Your legal magistrate, the Lord Protector, knew of my design, and is aware that I am here; the cry of blood will reach him, and you and your miserable victims will long lament the tragedy you are about to act".
My antagonist did not deign to reply, even by a look;--"You know your duty," he said to his comrades,--"obey".
In a moment I was thrown on the earth, bound, blindfolded, and hurried away --liberty of limb and sight was only restored to me, when, surrounded by dungeon-walls, dark and impervious, I found myself a prisoner and alone.
Such was the result of my attempt to gain over the proselyte of this man of crime; I could not conceive that he would dare put me to death.
--Yet I was in his hands; the path of his ambition had ever been dark and cruel; his power was founded upon fear; the one word which might cause me to die, unheard, unseen, in the obscurity of my dungeon, might be easier to speak than the deed of mercy to
He would not risk probably a public execution; but a private assassination would at once terrify any of my companions from attempting a like feat, at the same time that a cautious line of conduct might enable him to avoid the enquiries and the vengeance of
Two months ago, in a vault more obscure than the one I now inhabited, I had revolved the design of quietly laying me down to die; now I shuddered at the approach of fate.
My imagination was busied in shaping forth the kind of death he would inflict.
Would he allow me to wear out life with famine; or was the food administered to me to be medicined with death?
Would he steal on me in my sleep; or should I contend to the last with my murderers, knowing, even while I struggled, that I must be overcome?
I lived upon an earth whose diminished population a child's arithmetic might number; I had lived through long months with death stalking close at my side, while at intervals the shadow of his skeleton-shape darkened my path.
I had believed that I despised the grim phantom, and laughed his power to scorn.
Any other fate I should have met with courage, nay, have gone out gallantly to encounter.
But to be murdered thus at the midnight hour by cold-blooded assassins, no friendly hand to close my eyes, or receive my parting blessing--to die in combat, hate and execration--ah, why, my angel love, didst thou restore me to life, when already I had
Hours passed--centuries.
Could I give words to the many thoughts which occupied me in endless succession during this interval, I should fill volumes.
The air was dank, the dungeon-floor mildewed and icy cold; hunger came upon me too, and no sound reached me from without.
To-morrow the ruffian had declared that I should die.
When would to-morrow come?
Was it not already here?
My door was about to be opened.
I heard the key turn, and the bars and bolts slowly removed.
The opening of intervening passages permitted sounds from the interior of the palace to reach me; and I heard the clock strike one.
They come to murder me, I thought; this hour does not befit a public execution.
I drew myself up against the wall opposite the entrance; I collected my forces, I rallied my courage, I would not fall a tame prey.
Slowly the door receded on its hinges--I was ready to spring forward to seize and grapple with the intruder, till the sight of who it was changed at once the temper of my mind.
It was Juliet herself; pale and trembling she stood, a lamp in her hand, on the threshold of the dungeon, looking at me with wistful countenance.
But in a moment she re-assumed her self-possession; and her languid eyes recovered their brilliancy.
She said, "I am come to save you, Verney".
"And yourself also," I cried: "dearest friend, can we indeed be saved"?
"Not a word," she replied, "follow me"!
I obeyed instantly.
We threaded with light steps many corridors, ascended several flights of stairs, and passed through long galleries; at the end of one she unlocked a low portal; a rush of wind extinguished our lamp; but, in lieu of it, we had the blessed moon-beams and the
Then first Juliet spoke:--"You are safe," she said, "God bless you!
-- farewell"!
I seized her reluctant hand--"Dear friend," I cried, "misguided victim, do you not intend to escape with me?
Have you not risked all in facilitating my flight?
and do you think, that I will permit you to return, and suffer alone the effects of that miscreant's rage?
Never"!
"Do not fear for me," replied the lovely girl mournfully, "and do not imagine that without the consent of our chief you could be without these walls.
It is he that has saved you; he assigned to me the part of leading you hither, because I am best acquainted with your motives for coming here, and can best appreciate his mercy in permitting you to depart".
"And are you," I cried, "the dupe of this man?
He dreads me alive as an enemy, and dead he fears my avengers.
By favouring this clandestine escape he preserves a shew of consistency to his followers; but mercy is far from his heart.
Do you forget his artifices, his cruelty, and fraud?
As I am free, so are you.
Come, Juliet, the mother of our lost Idris will welcome you, the noble Adrian will rejoice to receive you; you will find peace and love, and better hopes than fanaticism can afford.
Come, and fear not; long before day we shall be at Versailles; close the door on this abode of crime --come, sweet Juliet, from hypocrisy and guilt to the society of the affectionate and good".
I spoke hurriedly, but with fervour: and while with gentle violence I drew her from the portal, some thought, some recollection of past scenes of youth and happiness, made her listen and yield to me; suddenly she broke away with a piercing shriek:--"My
he has my child; my darling girl is my hostage".
She darted from me into the passage; the gate closed between us--she was left in the fangs of this man of crime, a prisoner, still to inhale the pestilential atmosphere which adhered to his demoniac nature; the unimpeded breeze played on my cheek, the moon
Glad to have escaped, yet melancholy in my very joy, I retrod my steps to Versailles.
CHAPTER VI.
EVENTFUL winter passed; winter, the respite of our ills.
By degrees the sun, which with slant beams had before yielded the more extended reign to night, lengthened his diurnal journey, and mounted his highest throne, at once the fosterer of earth's new beauty, and her lover.
We who, like flies that congregate upon a dry rock at the ebbing of the tide, had played wantonly with time, allowing our passions, our hopes, and our mad desires to rule us, now heard the approaching roar of the ocean of destruction, and would have fled
We resolved without delay, to commence our journey to Switzerland; we became eager to leave France.
Under the icy vaults of the glaciers, beneath the shadow of the pines, the swinging of whose mighty branches was arrested by a load of snow; beside the streams whose intense cold proclaimed their origin to be from the slow-melting piles of congelated
We began our preparations at first with alacrity.
We did not now bid adieu to our native country, to the graves of those we loved, to the flowers, and streams, and trees, which had lived beside us from infancy.
Small sorrow would be ours on leaving Paris.
A scene of shame, when we remembered our late contentions, and thought that we left behind a flock of miserable, deluded victims, bending under the tyranny of a selfish impostor.
Small pangs should we feel in leaving the gardens, woods, and halls of the palaces of the Bourbons at Versailles, which we feared would soon be tainted by the dead, when we looked forward to vallies lovelier than any garden, to mighty forests and halls,
Yet our spirits flagged, as the day drew near which we had fixed for our departure.
Dire visions and evil auguries, if such things were, thickened around us, so that in vain might men say-- These are their reasons, they are natural,[1] we felt them to be ominous, and dreaded the future event enchained to them.
That the night owl should screech before the noon-day sun, that the hard-winged bat should wheel around the bed of beauty, that muttering thunder should in early spring startle the cloudless air, that sudden and exterminating blight should fall on the tree
Some had sight of funeral processions, and faces all begrimed with tears, which flitted through the long avenues of the gardens, and drew aside the curtains of the sleepers at dead of night.
Some heard wailing and cries in the air; a mournful chaunt would stream through the dark atmosphere, as if spirits above sang the requiem of the human race.
What was there in all this, but that fear created other senses within our frames, making us see, hear, and feel what was not?
What was this, but the action of diseased imaginations and childish credulity?
So might it be; but what was most real, was the existence of these very fears; the staring looks of horror, the faces pale even to ghastliness, the voices struck dumb with harrowing dread, of those among us who saw and heard these things.
Of this number was Adrian, who knew the delusion, yet could not cast off the clinging terror.
Even ignorant infancy appeared with timorous shrieks and convulsions to acknowledge the presence of unseen powers.
We must go: in change of scene, in occupation, and such security as we still hoped to find, we should discover a cure for these gathering horrors.
On mustering our company, we found them to consist of fourteen hundred souls, men, women, and children.
Until now therefore, we were undiminished in numbers, except by the desertion of those who had attached themselves to the impostor-prophet, and remained behind in Paris.
About fifty French joined us.
Our order of march was easily arranged; the ill success which had attended our division, determined Adrian to keep all in one body.
I, with an hundred men, went forward first as purveyor, taking the road of the Cote d'Or, through Auxerre, Dijon, Dole, over the Jura to Geneva.
I was to make arrangements, at every ten miles, for the accommodation of such numbers as I found the town or village would receive, leaving behind a messenger with a written order, signifying how many were to be quartered there.
The remainder of our tribe was then divided into bands of fifty each, every division containing eighteen men, and the remainder, consisting of women and children.
Each of these was headed by an officer, who carried the roll of names, by which they were each day to be mustered.
If the numbers were divided at night, in the morning those in the van waited for those in the rear.
At each of the large towns before mentioned, we were all to assemble; and a conclave of the principal officers would hold council for the general weal.
I went first, as I said; Adrian last.
His mother, with Clara and Evelyn under her protection, remained also with him.
Thus our order being determined, I departed.
My plan was to go at first no further than Fontainebleau, where in a few days I should be joined by Adrian, before I took flight again further eastward.
My friend accompanied me a few miles from Versailles.
He was sad; and, in a tone of unaccustomed despondency, uttered a prayer for our speedy arrival among the Alps, accompanied with an expression of vain regret that we were not already there.
"In that case," I observed, "we can quicken our march; why adhere to a plan whose dilatory proceeding you already disapprove"?
"Nay," replied he, "it is too late now.
A month ago, and we were masters of ourselves; now,--" he turned his face from me; though gathering twilight had already veiled its expression, he turned it yet more away, as he added --"a man died of the plague last night"!
He spoke in a smothered voice, then suddenly clasping his hands, he exclaimed, "Swiftly, most swiftly advances the last hour for us all; as the stars vanish before the sun, so will his near approach destroy us.
I have done my best; with grasping hands and impotent strength, I have hung on the wheel of the chariot of plague; but she drags me along with it, while, like Juggernaut, she proceeds crushing out the being of all who strew the high road of life.
Would that it were over--would that her procession achieved, we had all entered the tomb together"!
Tears streamed from his eyes.
"Again and again," he continued, "will the tragedy be acted; again I must hear the groans of the dying, the wailing of the survivors; again witness the pangs, which, consummating all, envelope an eternity in their evanescent existence.
Why am I reserved for this?
Why the tainted wether of the flock, am I not struck to earth among the first?
It is hard, very hard, for one of woman born to endure all that I endure"!
Hitherto, with an undaunted spirit, and an high feeling of duty and worth, Adrian had fulfilled his self-imposed task.
I had contemplated him with reverence, and a fruitless desire of imitation.
I now offered a few words of encouragement and sympathy.
He hid his face in his hands, and while he strove to calm himself, he ejaculated, "For a few months, yet for a few months more, let not, O God, my heart fail, or my courage be bowed down; let not sights of intolerable misery madden this half-crazed brain,
I have believed it to be my destiny to guide and rule the last of the race of man, till death extinguish my government; and to this destiny I submit.
"Pardon me, Verney, I pain you, but I will no longer complain.
Now I am myself again, or rather I am better than myself.
You have known how from my childhood aspiring thoughts and high desires have warred with inherent disease and overstrained sensitiveness, till the latter became victors.
You know how I placed this wasted feeble hand on the abandoned helm of human government.
I have been visited at times by intervals of fluctuation; yet, until now, I have felt as if a superior and indefatigable spirit had taken up its abode within me or rather incorporated itself with my weaker being.
The holy visitant has for a time slept, perhaps to show me how powerless I am without its inspiration.
Yet, stay for a while, O Power of goodness and strength; disdain not yet this rent shrine of fleshly mortality, O immortal Capability!
While one fellow creature remains to whom aid can be afforded, stay by and prop your shattered, falling engine"!
His vehemence, and voice broken by irrepressible sighs, sunk to my heart; his eyes gleamed in the gloom of night like two earthly stars; and, his form dilating, his countenance beaming, truly it almost seemed as if at his eloquent appeal a more than mortal
He turned quickly towards me, and held out his hand.
"Farewell, Verney," he cried, "brother of my love, farewell; no other weak expression must cross these lips, I am alive again: to our tasks, to our combats with our unvanquishable foe, for to the last I will struggle against her".
He grasped my hand, and bent a look on me, more fervent and animated than any smile; then turning his horse's head, he touched the animal with the spur, and was out of sight in a moment.
A man last night had died of the plague.
The quiver was not emptied, nor the bow unstrung.
We stood as marks, while Parthian Pestilence aimed and shot, insatiated by conquest, unobstructed by the heaps of slain.
A sickness of the soul, contagious even to my physical mechanism, came over me.
My knees knocked together, my teeth chattered, the current of my blood, clotted by sudden cold, painfully forced its way from my heavy heart.
I did not fear for myself, but it was misery to think that we could not even save this remnant.
That those I loved might in a few days be as clay-cold as Idris in her antique tomb; nor could strength of body or energy of mind ward off the blow.
A sense of degradation came over me.
Did God create man, merely in the end to become dead earth in the midst of healthful vegetating nature?
Was he of no more account to his Maker, than a field of corn blighted in the ear?
Were our proud dreams thus to fade?
Our name was written "a little lower than the angels;" and, behold, we were no better than ephemera.
We had called ourselves the "paragon of animals," and, lo!
we were a "quint-essence of dust".
We repined that the pyramids had outlasted the embalmed body of their builder.
Alas!
the mere shepherd's hut of straw we passed on the road, contained in its structure the principle of greater longevity than the whole race of man.
How reconcile this sad change to our past aspirations, to our apparent powers!
Sudden an internal voice, articulate and clear, seemed to say:--Thus from eternity, it was decreed: the steeds that bear Time onwards had this hour and this fulfilment enchained to them, since the void brought forth its burthen.
Would you read backwards the unchangeable laws of Necessity?
Mother of the world!
Servant of the Omnipotent!
eternal, changeless Necessity!
who with busy fingers sittest ever weaving the indissoluble chain of events!
--I will not murmur at thy acts.
If my human mind cannot acknowledge that all that is, is right; yet since what is, must be, I will sit amidst the ruins and smile.
Truly we were not born to enjoy, but to submit, and to hope.
Will not the reader tire, if I should minutely describe our long-drawn journey from Paris to Geneva?
If, day by day, I should record, in the form of a journal, the thronging miseries of our lot, could my hand write, or language afford words to express, the variety of our woe; the hustling and crowding of one deplorable event upon another?
Patience, oh reader!
whoever thou art, wherever thou dwellest, whether of race spiritual, or, sprung from some surviving pair, thy nature will be human, thy habitation the earth; thou wilt here read of the acts of the extinct race, and wilt ask wonderingly, if they, who
Most true, they were-- weep therefore; for surely, solitary being, thou wilt be of gentle disposition; shed compassionate tears; but the while lend thy attention to the tale, and learn the deeds and sufferings of thy predecessors.
Yet the last events that marked our progress through France were so full of strange horror and gloomy misery, that I dare not pause too long in the narration.
If I were to dissect each incident, every small fragment of a second would contain an harrowing tale, whose minutest word would curdle the blood in thy young veins.
It is right that I should erect for thy instruction this monument of the foregone race; but not that I should drag thee through the wards of an hospital, nor the secret chambers of the charnel-house.
This tale, therefore, shall be rapidly unfolded.
Images of destruction, pictures of despair, the procession of the last triumph of death, shall be drawn before thee, swift as the rack driven by the north wind along the blotted splendour of the sky.
Weed-grown fields, desolate towns, the wild approach of riderless horses had now become habitual to my eyes; nay, sights far worse, of the unburied dead, and human forms which were strewed on the road side, and on the steps of once frequented habitations,
[2] Sights like these had become--ah, woe the while!
so familiar, that we had ceased to shudder, or spur our stung horses to sudden speed, as we passed them.
France in its best days, at least that part of France through which we travelled, had been a cultivated desert, and the absence of enclosures, of cottages, and even of peasantry, was saddening to a traveller from sunny Italy, or busy England.
Yet the towns were frequent and lively, and the cordial politeness and ready smile of the wooden-shoed peasant restored good humour to the splenetic.
Now, the old woman sat no more at the door with her distaff--the lank beggar no longer asked charity in courtier-like phrase; nor on holidays did the peasantry thread with slow grace the mazes of the dance.
Silence, melancholy bride of death, went in procession with him from town to town through the spacious region.
We arrived at Fontainebleau, and speedily prepared for the reception of our friends.
On mustering our numbers for the night, three were found missing.
When I enquired for them, the man to whom I spoke, uttered the word "plague," and fell at my feet in convulsions; he also was infected.
There were hard faces around me; for among my troop were sailors who had crossed the line times unnumbered, soldiers who, in Russia and far America, had suffered famine, cold and danger, and men still sterner-featured, once nightly depredators in our
I looked round, and saw upon the faces of all horror and despair written in glaring characters.
We passed four days at Fontainebleau.
Several sickened and died, and in the mean time neither Adrian nor any of our friends appeared.
My own troop was in commotion; to reach Switzerland, to plunge into rivers of snow, and to dwell in caves of ice, became the mad desire of all.
Yet we had promised to wait for the Earl; and he came not.
My people demanded to be led forward-- rebellion, if so we might call what was the mere casting away of straw-formed shackles, appeared manifestly among them.
They would away on the word without a leader.
The only chance of safety, the only hope of preservation from every form of indescribable suffering, was our keeping together.
I told them this; while the most determined among them answered with sullenness, that they could take care of themselves, and replied to my entreaties with scoffs and menaces.
At length, on the fifth day, a messenger arrived from Adrian, bearing letters, which directed us to proceed to Auxerre, and there await his arrival, which would only be deferred for a few days.
Such was the tenor of his public letters.
Those privately delivered to me, detailed at length the difficulties of his situation, and left the arrangement of my future plans to my own discretion.
His account of the state of affairs at Versailles was brief, but the oral communications of his messenger filled up his omissions, and shewed me that perils of the most frightful nature were gathering around him.
At first the re-awakening of the plague had been concealed; but the number of deaths encreasing, the secret was divulged, and the destruction already achieved, was exaggerated by the fears of the survivors.
Some emissaries of the enemy of mankind, the accursed Impostors, were among them instilling their doctrine that safety and life could only be ensured by submission to their chief; and they succeeded so well, that soon, instead of desiring to proceed to
The discord and tumult induced by these conflicting fears and passions, detained Adrian.
It required all his ardour in pursuit of an object, and his patience under difficulties, to calm and animate such a number of his followers, as might counterbalance the panic of the rest, and lead them back to the means from which alone safety could be
He had hoped immediately to follow me; but, being defeated in this intention, he sent his messenger urging me to secure my own troop at such a distance from Versailles, as to prevent the contagion of rebellion from reaching them; promising, at the same
I was thrown into a most painful state of uncertainty by these communications.
My first impulse was that we should all return to Versailles, there to assist in extricating our chief from his perils.
I accordingly assembled my troop, and proposed to them this retrograde movement, instead of the continuation of our journey to Auxerre.
With one voice they refused to comply.
The notion circulated among them was, that the ravages of the plague alone detained the Protector; they opposed his order to my request; they came to a resolve to proceed without me, should I refuse to accompany them.
Argument and adjuration were lost on these dastards.
The continual diminution of their own numbers, effected by pestilence, added a sting to their dislike of delay; and my opposition only served to bring their resolution to a crisis.
That same evening they departed towards Auxerre.
Oaths, as from soldiers to their general, had been taken by them: these they broke.
I also had engaged myself not to desert them; it appeared to me inhuman to ground any infraction of my word on theirs.
The same spirit that caused them to rebel against me, would impel them to desert each other; and the most dreadful sufferings would be the consequence of their journey in their present unordered and chiefless array.
These feelings for a time were paramount; and, in obedience to them, I accompanied the rest towards Auxerre.
We arrived the same night at Villeneuve-la-Guiard, a town at the distance of four posts from Fontainebleau.
When my companions had retired to rest, and I was left alone to revolve and ruminate upon the intelligence I received of Adrian's situation, another view of the subject presented itself to me.
What was I doing, and what was the object of my present movements?
Apparently I was to lead this troop of selfish and lawless men towards Switzerland, leaving behind my family and my selected friend, which, subject as they were hourly to the death that threatened to all, I might never see again.
Was it not my first duty to assist the Protector, setting an example of attachment and duty?
At a crisis, such as the one I had reached, it is very difficult to balance nicely opposing interests, and that towards which our inclinations lead us, obstinately assumes the appearance of selfishness, even when we meditate a sacrifice.
We are easily led at such times to make a compromise of the question; and this was my present resource.
I resolved that very night to ride to Versailles; if I found affairs less desperate than I now deemed them, I would return without delay to my troop; I had a vague idea that my arrival at that town, would occasion some sensation more or less strong, of
I was glad to escape from my rebellious troop, and to lose sight for a time, of the strife of evil with good, where the former for ever remained triumphant.
I was stung almost to madness by my uncertainty concerning the fate of Adrian, and grew reckless of any event, except what might lose or preserve my unequalled friend.
With an heavy heart, that sought relief in the rapidity of my course, I rode through the night to Versailles.
I spurred my horse, who addressed his free limbs to speed, and tossed his gallant head in pride.
The constellations reeled swiftly by, swiftly each tree and stone and landmark fled past my onward career.
I bared my head to the rushing wind, which bathed my brow in delightful coolness.
As I lost sight of Villeneuve-la-Guiard, I forgot the sad drama of human misery; methought it was happiness enough to live, sensitive the while of the beauty of the verdure-clad earth, the star-bespangled sky, and the tameless wind that lent animation to
My horse grew tired--and I, forgetful of his fatigue, still as he lagged, cheered him with my voice, and urged him with the spur.
He was a gallant animal, and I did not wish to exchange him for any chance beast I might light on, leaving him never to be refound.
All night we went forward; in the morning he became sensible that we approached Versailles, to reach which as his home, he mustered his flagging strength.
The distance we had come was not less than fifty miles, yet he shot down the long Boulevards swift as an arrow; poor fellow, as I dismounted at the gate of the castle, he sunk on his knees, his eyes were covered with a film, he fell on his side, a few
I saw him expire with an anguish, unaccountable even to myself, the spasm was as the wrenching of some limb in agonizing torture, but it was brief as it was intolerable.
I forgot him, as I swiftly darted through the open portal, and up the majestic stairs of this castle of victories--heard Adrian's voice--O fool!
O woman nurtured, effeminate and contemptible being--I heard his voice, and answered it with convulsive shrieks; I rushed into the Hall of Hercules, where he stood surrounded by a crowd, whose eyes, turned in wonder on me, reminded me that on the stage of
I would have given worlds to have embraced him; I dared not--Half in exhaustion, half voluntarily, I threw myself at my length on the ground-- dare I disclose the truth to the gentle offspring of solitude?
I did so, that I might kiss the dear and sacred earth he trod.
I found everything in a state of tumult.
An emissary of the leader of the elect, had been so worked up by his chief, and by his own fanatical creed, as to make an attempt on the life of the Protector and preserver of lost mankind.
His hand was arrested while in the act of poignarding the Earl; this circumstance had caused the clamour I heard on my arrival at the castle, and the confused assembly of persons that I found assembled in the Salle d'Hercule.
Although superstition and demoniac fury had crept among the emigrants, yet several adhered with fidelity to their noble chieftain; and many, whose faith and love had been unhinged by fear, felt all their latent affection rekindled by this detestable
A phalanx of faithful breasts closed round him; the wretch, who, although a prisoner and in bonds, vaunted his design, and madly claimed the crown of martyrdom, would have been torn to pieces, had not his intended victim interposed.
Adrian, springing forward, shielded him with his own person, and commanded with energy the submission of his infuriate friends--at this moment I had entered.
Discipline and peace were at length restored in the castle; and then Adrian went from house to house, from troop to troop, to soothe the disturbed minds of his followers, and recall them to their ancient obedience.
But the fear of immediate death was still rife amongst these survivors of a world's destruction; the horror occasioned by the attempted assassination, past away; each eye turned towards Paris.
Men love a prop so well, that they will lean on a pointed poisoned spear; and such was he, the impostor, who, with fear of hell for his scourge, most ravenous wolf, played the driver to a credulous flock.
It was a moment of suspense, that shook even the resolution of the unyielding friend of man.
Adrian for one moment was about to give in, to cease the struggle, and quit, with a few adherents, the deluded crowd, leaving them a miserable prey to their passions, and to the worse tyrant who excited them.
But again, after a brief fluctuation of purpose, he resumed his courage and resolves, sustained by the singleness of his purpose, and the untried spirit of benevolence which animated him.
At this moment, as an omen of excellent import, his wretched enemy pulled destruction on his head, destroying with his own hands the dominion he had erected.
His grand hold upon the minds of men, took its rise from the doctrine inculcated by him, that those who believed in, and followed him, were the remnant to be saved, while all the rest of mankind were marked out for death.
Now, at the time of the Flood, the omnipotent repented him that he had created man, and as then with water, now with the arrows of pestilence, was about to annihilate all, except those who obeyed his decrees, promulgated by the ipse dixit prophet.
It is impossible to say on what foundations this man built his hopes of being able to carry on such an imposture.
It is likely that he was fully aware of the lie which murderous nature might give to his assertions, and believed it to be the cast of a die, whether he should in future ages be reverenced as an inspired delegate from heaven, or be recognized as an
At any rate he resolved to keep up the drama to the last act.
When, on the first approach of summer, the fatal disease again made its ravages among the followers of Adrian, the impostor exultingly proclaimed the exemption of his own congregation from the universal calamity.
He was believed; his followers, hitherto shut up in Paris, now came to Versailles.
Mingling with the coward band there assembled, they reviled their admirable leader, and asserted their own superiority and exemption.
At length the plague, slow-footed, but sure in her noiseless advance, destroyed the illusion, invading the congregation of the elect, and showering promiscuous death among them.
Their leader endeavoured to conceal this event; he had a few followers, who, admitted into the arcana of his wickedness, could help him in the execution of his nefarious designs.
Those who sickened were immediately and quietly withdrawn, the cord and a midnight-grave disposed of them for ever; while some plausible excuse was given for their absence.
At last a female, whose maternal vigilance subdued even the effects of the narcotics administered to her, became a witness of their murderous designs on her only child.
Mad with horror, she would have burst among her deluded fellow-victims, and, wildly shrieking, have awaked the dull ear of night with the history of the fiend-like crime; when the Impostor, in his last act of rage and desperation, plunged a poignard in her
Thus wounded to death, her garments dripping with her own life-blood, bearing her strangled infant in her arms, beautiful and young as she was, Juliet, (for it was she) denounced to the host of deceived believers, the wickedness of their leader.
He saw the aghast looks of her auditors, changing from horror to fury--the names of those already sacrificed were echoed by their relatives, now assured of their loss.
The wretch with that energy of purpose, which had borne him thus far in his guilty career, saw his danger, and resolved to evade the worst forms of it--he rushed on one of the foremost, seized a pistol from his girdle, and his loud laugh of derision
They left his miserable remains even where they lay; they placed the corpse of poor Juliet and her babe upon a bier, and all, with hearts subdued to saddest regret, in long procession walked towards Versailles.
They met troops of those who had quitted the kindly protection of Adrian, and were journeying to join the fanatics.
The tale of horror was recounted--all turned back; and thus at last, accompanied by the undiminished numbers of surviving humanity, and preceded by the mournful emblem of their recovered reason, they appeared before Adrian, and again and for ever vowed

CHAPTER VII.
THESE events occupied so much time, that June had numbered more than half its days, before we again commenced our long-protracted journey.
The day after my return to Versailles, six men, from among those I had left at Villeneuve-la-Guiard, arrived, with intelligence, that the rest of the troop had already proceeded towards Switzerland.
We went forward in the same track.
It is strange, after an interval of time, to look back on a period, which, though short in itself, appeared, when in actual progress, to be drawn out interminably.
By the end of July we entered Dijon; by the end of July those hours, days, and weeks had mingled with the ocean of forgotten time, which in their passage teemed with fatal events and agonizing sorrow.
By the end of July, little more than a month had gone by, if man's life were measured by the rising and setting of the sun: but, alas!
in that interval ardent youth had become grey-haired; furrows deep and uneraseable were trenched in the blooming cheek of the young mother; the elastic limbs of early manhood, paralyzed as by the burthen of years, assumed the decrepitude of age.
Nights passed, during whose fatal darkness the sun grew old before it rose; and burning days, to cool whose baleful heat the balmy eve, lingering far in eastern climes, came lagging and ineffectual; days, in which the dial, radiant in its noon-day station,
We departed from Versailles fifteen hundred souls.
We set out on the eighteenth of June.
We made a long procession, in which was contained every dear relationship, or tie of love, that existed in human society.
Fathers and husbands, with guardian care, gathered their dear relatives around them; wives and mothers looked for support to the manly form beside them, and then with tender anxiety bent their eyes on the infant troop around.
They were sad, but not hopeless.
Each thought that someone would be saved; each, with that pertinacious optimism, which to the last characterized our human nature, trusted that their beloved family would be the one preserved.
We passed through France, and found it empty of inhabitants.
Some one or two natives survived in the larger towns, which they roamed through like ghosts; we received therefore small encrease to our numbers, and such decrease through death, that at last it became easier to count the scanty list of survivors.
As we never deserted any of the sick, until their death permitted us to commit their remains to the shelter of a grave, our journey was long, while every day a frightful gap was made in our troop--they died by tens, by fifties, by hundreds.
No mercy was shewn by death; we ceased to expect it, and every day welcomed the sun with the feeling that we might never see it rise again.
The nervous terrors and fearful visions which had scared us during the spring, continued to visit our coward troop during this sad journey.
Every evening brought its fresh creation of spectres; a ghost was depicted by every blighted tree; and appalling shapes were manufactured from each shaggy bush.
By degrees these common marvels palled on us, and then other wonders were called into being.
Once it was confidently asserted, that the sun rose an hour later than its seasonable time; again it was discovered that he grew paler and paler; that shadows took an uncommon appearance.
It was impossible to have imagined, during the usual calm routine of life men had before experienced, the terrible effects produced by these extravagant delusions: in truth, of such little worth are our senses, when unsupported by concurring testimony,
Being one sane amidst a crowd of the mad, I hardly dared assert to my own mind, that the vast luminary had undergone no change--that the shadows of night were unthickened by innumerable shapes of awe and terror; or that the wind, as it sung in the trees,
Sometimes realities took ghostly shapes; and it was impossible for one's blood not to curdle at the perception of an evident mixture of what we knew to be true, with the visionary semblance of all that we feared.
Once, at the dusk of the evening, we saw a figure all in white, apparently of more than human stature, flourishing about the road, now throwing up its arms, now leaping to an astonishing height in the air, then turning round several times successively,
Our troop, on the alert to discover and believe in the supernatural, made a halt at some distance from this shape; and, as it became darker, there was something appalling even to the incredulous, in the lonely spectre, whose gambols, if they hardly
Now it leapt right up in the air, now sheer over a high hedge, and was again the moment after in the road before us.
By the time I came up, the fright experienced by the spectators of this ghostly exhibition, began to manifest itself in the flight of some, and the close huddling together of the rest.
Our goblin now perceived us; he approached, and, as we drew reverentially back, made a low bow.
The sight was irresistibly ludicrous even to our hapless band, and his politeness was hailed by a shout of laughter;--then, again springing up, as a last effort, it sunk to the ground, and became almost invisible through the dusky night.
This circumstance again spread silence and fear through the troop; the more courageous at length advanced, and, raising the dying wretch, discovered the tragic explanation of this wild scene.
It was an opera-dancer, and had been one of the troop which deserted from Villeneuve-la-Guiard: falling sick, he had been deserted by his companions; in an access of delirium he had fancied himself on the stage, and, poor fellow, his dying sense eagerly
At another time we were haunted for several days by an apparition, to which our people gave the appellation of the Black Spectre.
We never saw it except at evening, when his coal black steed, his mourning dress, and plume of black feathers, had a majestic and awe-striking appearance; his face, one said, who had seen it for a moment, was ashy pale; he had lingered far behind the rest
Sometimes at dead of night, as we watched the sick, we heard one galloping through the town; it was the Black Spectre come in token of inevitable death.
He grew giant tall to vulgar eyes; an icy atmosphere, they said, surrounded him; when he was heard, all animals shuddered, and the dying knew that their last hour was come.
It was Death himself, they declared, come visibly to seize on subject earth, and quell at once our decreasing numbers, sole rebels to his law.
One day at noon, we saw a dark mass on the road before us, and, coming up, beheld the Black Spectre fallen from his horse, lying in the agonies of disease upon the ground.
He did not survive many hours; and his last words disclosed the secret of his mysterious conduct.
He was a French noble of distinction, who, from the effects of plague, had been left alone in his district; during many months, he had wandered from town to town, from province to province, seeking some survivor for a companion, and abhorring the
When he discovered our troop, fear of contagion conquered his love of society.
He dared not join us, yet he could not resolve to lose sight of us, sole human beings who besides himself existed in wide and fertile France; so he accompanied us in the spectral guise I have described, till pestilence gathered him to a larger
It had been well, if such vain terrors could have distracted our thoughts from more tangible evils.
But these were too dreadful and too many not to force themselves into every thought, every moment, of our lives.
We were obliged to halt at different periods for days together, till another and yet another was consigned as a clod to the vast clod which had been once our living mother.
Thus we continued travelling during the hottest season; and it was not till the first of August, that we, the emigrants,--reader, there were just eighty of us in number,--entered the gates of Dijon.
We had expected this moment with eagerness, for now we had accomplished the worst part of our drear journey, and Switzerland was near at hand.
Yet how could we congratulate ourselves on any event thus imperfectly fulfilled?
Were these miserable beings, who, worn and wretched, passed in sorrowful procession, the sole remnants of the race of man, which, like a flood, had once spread over and possessed the whole earth?
It had come down clear and unimpeded from its primal mountain source in Ararat, and grew from a puny streamlet to a vast perennial river, generation after generation flowing on ceaselessly.
The same, but diversified, it grew, and swept onwards towards the absorbing ocean, whose dim shores we now reached.
It had been the mere plaything of nature, when first it crept out of uncreative void into light; but thought brought forth power and knowledge; and, clad with these, the race of man assumed dignity and authority.
It was then no longer the mere gardener of earth, or the shepherd of her flocks; "it carried with it an imposing and majestic aspect; it had a pedigree and illustrious ancestors; it had its gallery of portraits, its monumental inscriptions, its records and
[1] This was all over, now that the ocean of death had sucked in the slackening tide, and its source was dried up.
We first had bidden adieu to the state of things which having existed many thousand years, seemed eternal; such a state of government, obedience, traffic, and domestic intercourse, as had moulded our hearts and capacities, as far back as memory could
Then to patriotic zeal, to the arts, to reputation, to enduring fame, to the name of country, we had bidden farewell.
We saw depart all hope of retrieving our ancient state--all expectation, except the feeble one of saving our individual lives from the wreck of the past.
To preserve these we had quitted England--England, no more; for without her children, what name could that barren island claim?
With tenacious grasp we clung to such rule and order as could best save us; trusting that, if a little colony could be preserved, that would suffice at some remoter period to restore the lost community of mankind.
But the game is up!
We must all die; nor leave survivor nor heir to the wide inheritance of earth.
We must all die!
The species of man must perish; his frame of exquisite workmanship; the wondrous mechanism of his senses; the noble proportion of his godlike limbs; his mind, the throned king of these; must perish.
Will the earth still keep her place among the planets; will she still journey with unmarked regularity round the sun; will the seasons change, the trees adorn themselves with leaves, and flowers shed their fragrance, in solitude?
Will the mountains remain unmoved, and streams still keep a downward course towards the vast abyss; will the tides rise and fall, and the winds fan universal nature; will beasts pasture, birds fly, and fishes swim, when man, the lord, possessor, perceiver,
O, what mockery is this!
Surely death is not death, and humanity is not extinct; but merely passed into other shapes, unsubjected to our perceptions.
Death is a vast portal, an high road to life: let us hasten to pass; let us exist no more in this living death, but die that we may live!
We had longed with inexpressible earnestness to reach Dijon, since we had fixed on it, as a kind of station in our progress.
But now we entered it with a torpor more painful than acute suffering.
We had come slowly but irrevocably to the opinion, that our utmost efforts would not preserve one human being alive.
We took our hands therefore away from the long grasped rudder; and the frail vessel on which we floated, seemed, the government over her suspended, to rush, prow foremost, into the dark abyss of the billows.
A gush of grief, a wanton profusion of tears, and vain laments, and overflowing tenderness, and passionate but fruitless clinging to the priceless few that remained, was followed by languor and recklessness.
During this disastrous journey we lost all those, not of our own family, to whom we had particularly attached ourselves among the survivors.
It were not well to fill these pages with a mere catalogue of losses; yet I cannot refrain from this last mention of those principally dear to us.
The little girl whom Adrian had rescued from utter desertion, during our ride through London on the twentieth of November, died at Auxerre.
The poor child had attached herself greatly to us; and the suddenness of her death added to our sorrow.
In the morning we had seen her apparently in health--in the evening, Lucy, before we retired to rest, visited our quarters to say that she was dead.
Poor Lucy herself only survived, till we arrived at Dijon.
She had devoted herself throughout to the nursing the sick, and attending the friendless.
Her excessive exertions brought on a slow fever, which ended in the dread disease whose approach soon released her from her sufferings.
She had throughout been endeared to us by her good qualities, by her ready and cheerful execution of every duty, and mild acquiescence in every turn of adversity.
When we consigned her to the tomb, we seemed at the same time to bid a final adieu to those peculiarly feminine virtues conspicuous in her; uneducated and unpretending as she was, she was distinguished for patience, forbearance, and sweetness.
These, with all their train of qualities peculiarly English, would never again be revived for us.
This type of all that was most worthy of admiration in her class among my countrywomen, was placed under the sod of desert France; and it was as a second separation from our country to have lost sight of her for ever.
The Countess of Windsor died during our abode at Dijon.
One morning I was informed that she wished to see me.
Her message made me remember, that several days had elapsed since I had last seen her.
Such a circumstance had often occurred during our journey, when I remained behind to watch to their close the last moments of some one of our hapless comrades, and the rest of the troop past on before me.
But there was something in the manner of her messenger, that made me suspect that all was not right.
A caprice of the imagination caused me to conjecture that some ill had occurred to Clara or Evelyn, rather than to this aged lady.
Our fears, for ever on the stretch, demanded a nourishment of horror; and it seemed too natural an occurrence, too like past times, for the old to die before the young.
I found the venerable mother of my Idris lying on a couch, her tall emaciated figure stretched out; her face fallen away, from which the nose stood out in sharp profile, and her large dark eyes, hollow and deep, gleamed with such light as may edge a
All was shrivelled and dried up, except these lights; her voice too was fearfully changed, as she spoke to me at intervals.
"I am afraid," said she, "that it is selfish in me to have asked you to visit the old woman again, before she dies: yet perhaps it would have been a greater shock to hear suddenly that I was dead, than to see me first thus".
I clasped her shrivelled hand: "Are you indeed so ill"?
I asked.
"Do you not perceive death in my face," replied she, "it is strange; I ought to have expected this, and yet I confess it has taken me unaware.
I never clung to life, or enjoyed it, till these last months, while among those I senselessly deserted: and it is hard to be snatched immediately away.
I am glad, however, that I am not a victim of the plague; probably I should have died at this hour, though the world had continued as it was in my youth".
She spoke with difficulty, and I perceived that she regretted the necessity of death, even more than she cared to confess.
Yet she had not to complain of an undue shortening of existence; her faded person shewed that life had naturally spent itself.
We had been alone at first; now Clara entered; the Countess turned to her with a smile, and took the hand of this lovely child; her roseate palm and snowy fingers, contrasted with relaxed fibres and yellow hue of those of her aged friend; she bent to kiss
"Verney," said the Countess, "I need not recommend this dear girl to you, for your own sake you will preserve her.
Were the world as it was, I should have a thousand sage precautions to impress, that one so sensitive, good, and beauteous, might escape the dangers that used to lurk for the destruction of the fair and excellent.
This is all nothing now.
"I commit you, my kind nurse, to your uncle's care; to yours I entrust the dearest relic of my better self.
Be to Adrian, sweet one, what you have been to me--enliven his sadness with your sprightly sallies; sooth his anguish by your sober and inspired converse, when he is dying; nurse him as you have done me".
Clara burst into tears; "Kind girl," said the Countess, "do not weep for me.
Many dear friends are left to you".
"And yet," cried Clara, "you talk of their dying also.
This is indeed cruel --how could I live, if they were gone?
If it were possible for my beloved protector to die before me, I could not nurse him; I could only die too".
The venerable lady survived this scene only twenty-four hours.
She was the last tie binding us to the ancient state of things.
It was impossible to look on her, and not call to mind in their wonted guise, events and persons, as alien to our present situation as the disputes of Themistocles and Aristides, or the wars of the two roses in our native land.
The crown of England had pressed her brow; the memory of my father and his misfortunes, the vain struggles of the late king, the images of Raymond, Evadne, and Perdita, who had lived in the world's prime, were brought vividly before us.
We consigned her to the oblivious tomb with reluctance; and when I turned from her grave, Janus veiled his retrospective face; that which gazed on future generations had long lost its faculty.
After remaining a week at Dijon, until thirty of our number deserted the vacant ranks of life, we continued our way towards Geneva.
At noon on the second day we arrived at the foot of Jura.
We halted here during the heat of the day.
Here fifty human beings--fifty, the only human beings that survived of the food-teeming earth, assembled to read in the looks of each other ghastly plague, or wasting sorrow, desperation, or worse, carelessness of future or present evil.
Here we assembled at the foot of this mighty wall of mountain, under a spreading walnut tree; a brawling stream refreshed the green sward by its sprinkling; and the busy grasshopper chirped among the thyme.
We clustered together a group of wretched sufferers.
A mother cradled in her enfeebled arms the child, last of many, whose glazed eye was about to close for ever.
Here beauty, late glowing in youthful lustre and consciousness, now wan and neglected, knelt fanning with uncertain motion the beloved, who lay striving to paint his features, distorted by illness, with a thankful smile.
There an hard-featured, weather-worn veteran, having prepared his meal, sat, his head dropped on his breast, the useless knife falling from his grasp, his limbs utterly relaxed, as thought of wife and child, and dearest relative, all lost, passed across
There sat a man who for forty years had basked in fortune's tranquil sunshine; he held the hand of his last hope, his beloved daughter, who had just attained womanhood; and he gazed on her with anxious eyes, while she tried to rally her fainting spirit to
Here a servant, faithful to the last, though dying, waited on one, who, though still erect with health, gazed with gasping fear on the variety of woe around.
Adrian stood leaning against a tree; he held a book in his hand, but his eye wandered from the pages, and sought mine; they mingled a sympathetic glance; his looks confessed that his thoughts had quitted the inanimate print, for pages more pregnant with
By the margin of the stream, apart from all, in a tranquil nook, where the purling brook kissed the green sward gently, Clara and Evelyn were at play, sometimes beating the water with large boughs, sometimes watching the summer-flies that sported upon it.
Evelyn now chased a butterfly--now gathered a flower for his cousin; and his laughing cherub-face and clear brow told of the light heart that beat in his bosom.
Clara, though she endeavoured to give herself up to his amusement, often forgot him, as she turned to observe Adrian and me.
She was now fourteen, and retained her childish appearance, though in height a woman; she acted the part of the tenderest mother to my little orphan boy; to see her playing with him, or attending silently and submissively on our wants, you thought only of
When the sun had sunk towards the precipitate west, and the evening shadows grew long, we prepared to ascend the mountain.
The attention that we were obliged to pay to the sick, made our progress slow.
The winding road, though steep, presented a confined view of rocky fields and hills, each hiding the other, till our farther ascent disclosed them in succession.
We were seldom shaded from the declining sun, whose slant beams were instinct with exhausting heat.
There are times when minor difficulties grow gigantic --times, when as the Hebrew poet expressively terms it, "the grasshopper is a burthen;" so was it with our ill fated party this evening.
Adrian, usually the first to rally his spirits, and dash foremost into fatigue and hardship, with relaxed limbs and declined head, the reins hanging loosely in his grasp, left the choice of the path to the instinct of his horse, now and then painfully
Fear and horror encompassed me.
Did his languid air attest that he also was struck with contagion?
How long, when I look on this matchless specimen of mortality, may I perceive that his thought answers mine?
how long will those limbs obey the kindly spirit within?
how long will light and life dwell in the eyes of this my sole remaining friend?
Thus pacing slowly, each hill surmounted, only presented another to be ascended; each jutting corner only discovered another, sister to the last, endlessly.
Sometimes the pressure of sickness in one among us, caused the whole cavalcade to halt; the call for water, the eagerly expressed wish to repose; the cry of pain, and suppressed sob of the mourner--such were the sorrowful attendants of our passage of the
Adrian had gone first.
I saw him, while I was detained by the loosening of a girth, struggling with the upward path, seemingly more difficult than any we had yet passed.
He reached the top, and the dark outline of his figure stood in relief against the sky.
He seemed to behold something unexpected and wonderful; for, pausing, his head stretched out, his arms for a moment extended, he seemed to give an All Hail!
to some new vision.
Urged by curiosity, I hurried to join him.
After battling for many tedious minutes with the precipice, the same scene presented itself to me, which had wrapt him in extatic wonder.
Nature, or nature's favourite, this lovely earth, presented her most unrivalled beauties in resplendent and sudden exhibition.
Below, far, far below, even as it were in the yawning abyss of the ponderous globe, lay the placid and azure expanse of lake Leman; vine-covered hills hedged it in, and behind dark mountains in cone-like shape, or irregular cyclopean wall, served for
But beyond, and high above all, as if the spirits of the air had suddenly unveiled their bright abodes, placed in scaleless altitude in the stainless sky, heaven-kissing, companions of the unattainable ether, were the glorious Alps, clothed in dazzling
And, as if the world's wonders were never to be exhausted, their vast immensities, their jagged crags, and roseate painting, appeared again in the lake below, dipping their proud heights beneath the unruffled waves--palaces for the Naiads of the placid
Towns and villages lay scattered at the foot of Jura, which, with dark ravine, and black promontories, stretched its roots into the watery expanse beneath.
Carried away by wonder, I forgot the death of man, and the living and beloved friend near me.
When I turned, I saw tears streaming from his eyes; his thin hands pressed one against the other, his animated countenance beaming with admiration; "Why," cried he, at last, "Why, oh heart, whisperest thou of grief to me?
Drink in the beauty of that scene, and possess delight beyond what a fabled paradise could afford".
By degrees, our whole party surmounting the steep, joined us, not one among them, but gave visible tokens of admiration, surpassing any before experienced.
One cried, "God reveals his heaven to us; we may die blessed".
Another and another, with broken exclamations, and extravagant phrases, endeavoured to express the intoxicating effect of this wonder of nature.
So we remained awhile, lightened of the pressing burthen of fate, forgetful of death, into whose night we were about to plunge; no longer reflecting that our eyes now and for ever were and would be the only ones which might perceive the divine magnificence
An enthusiastic transport, akin to happiness, burst, like a sudden ray from the sun, on our darkened life.
Precious attribute of woe-worn humanity!
that can snatch extatic emotion, even from under the very share and harrow, that ruthlessly ploughs up and lays waste every hope.
This evening was marked by another event.
Passing through Ferney in our way to Geneva, unaccustomed sounds of music arose from the rural church which stood embosomed in trees, surrounded by smokeless, vacant cottages.
The peal of an organ with rich swell awoke the mute air, lingering along, and mingling with the intense beauty that clothed the rocks and woods, and waves around.
Music--the language of the immortals, disclosed to us as testimony of their existence--music, "silver key of the fountain of tears," child of love, soother of grief, inspirer of heroism and radiant thoughts, O music, in this our desolation, we had
Nor pipe at eve cheered us, nor harmony of voice, nor linked thrill of string; thou camest upon us now, like the revealing of other forms of being; and transported as we had been by the loveliness of nature, fancying that we beheld the abode of spirits,
We paused in such awe as would seize on a pale votarist, visiting some holy shrine at midnight; if she beheld animated and smiling, the image which she worshipped.
We all stood mute; many knelt.
In a few minutes however, we were recalled to human wonder and sympathy by a familiar strain.
The air was Haydn's "New-Created World," and, old and drooping as humanity had become, the world yet fresh as at creation's day, might still be worthily celebrated by such an hymn of praise.
Adrian and I entered the church; the nave was empty, though the smoke of incense rose from the altar, bringing with it the recollection of vast congregations, in once thronged cathedrals; we went into the loft.
A blind old man sat at the bellows; his whole soul was ear; and as he sat in the attitude of attentive listening, a bright glow of pleasure was diffused over his countenance; for, though his lack-lustre eye could not reflect the beam, yet his parted lips,
A young woman sat at the keys, perhaps twenty years of age.
Her auburn hair hung on her neck, and her fair brow shone in its own beauty; but her drooping eyes let fall fast-flowing tears, while the constraint she exercised to suppress her sobs, and still her trembling, flushed her else pale cheek; she was thin;
sickness, bent her form.
We stood looking at the pair, forgetting what we heard in the absorbing sight; till, the last chord struck, the peal died away in lessening reverberations.
The mighty voice, inorganic we might call it, for we could in no way associate it with mechanism of pipe or key, stilled its sonorous tone, and the girl, turning to lend her assistance to her aged companion, at length perceived us.
It was her father; and she, since childhood, had been the guide of his darkened steps.
They were Germans from Saxony, and, emigrating thither but a few years before, had formed new ties with the surrounding villagers.
About the time that the pestilence had broken out, a young German student had joined them.
Their simple history was easily divined.
He, a noble, loved the fair daughter of the poor musician, and followed them in their flight from the persecutions of his friends; but soon the mighty leveller came with unblunted scythe to mow, together with the grass, the tall flowers of the field.
The youth was an early victim.
She preserved herself for her father's sake.
His blindness permitted her to continue a delusion, at first the child of accident--and now solitary beings, sole survivors in the land, he remained unacquainted with the change, nor was aware that when he listened to his child's music, the mute mountains,
The very day that we arrived she had been attacked by symptomatic illness.
She was paralyzed with horror at the idea of leaving her aged, sightless father alone on the empty earth; but she had not courage to disclose the truth, and the very excess of her desperation animated her to surpassing exertions.
At the accustomed vesper hour, she led him to the chapel; and, though trembling and weeping on his account, she played, without fault in time, or error in note, the hymn written to celebrate the creation of the adorned earth, soon to be her tomb.
We came to her like visitors from heaven itself; her high-wrought courage; her hardly sustained firmness, fled with the appearance of relief.
With a shriek she rushed towards us, embraced the knees of Adrian, and uttering but the words, "O save my father"!
with sobs and hysterical cries, opened the long-shut floodgates of her woe.
Poor girl!
--she and her father now lie side by side, beneath the high walnut-tree where her lover reposes, and which in her dying moments she had pointed out to us.
Her father, at length aware of his daughter's danger, unable to see the changes of her dear countenance, obstinately held her hand, till it was chilled and stiffened by death.
Nor did he then move or speak, till, twelve hours after, kindly death took him to his breakless repose.
They rest beneath the sod, the tree their monument;--the hallowed spot is distinct in my memory, paled in by craggy Jura, and the far, immeasurable Alps; the spire of the church they frequented still points from out the embosoming trees; and though her

WE had now reached Switzerland, so long the final mark and aim of our exertions.
We had looked, I know not wherefore, with hope and pleasing expectation on her congregation of hills and snowy crags, and opened our bosoms with renewed spirits to the icy Biz, which even at Midsummer used to come from the northern glacier laden with cold.
Yet how could we nourish expectation of relief?
Like our native England, and the vast extent of fertile France, this mountain-embowered land was desolate of its inhabitants.
Nor bleak mountain-top, nor snow-nourished rivulet; not the ice-laden Biz, nor thunder, the tamer of contagion, had preserved them-- why therefore should we claim exemption?
Who was there indeed to save?
What troop had we brought fit to stand at bay, and combat with the conqueror?
We were a failing remnant, tamed to mere submission to the coming blow.
A train half dead, through fear of death--a hopeless, unresisting, almost reckless crew, which, in the tossed bark of life, had given up all pilotage, and resigned themselves to the destructive force of ungoverned winds.
Like a few furrows of unreaped corn, which, left standing on a wide field after the rest is gathered to the garner, are swiftly borne down by the winter storm.
Like a few straggling swallows, which, remaining after their fellows had, on the first unkind breath of passing autumn, migrated to genial climes, were struck to earth by the first frost of November.
Like a stray sheep that wanders over the sleet-beaten hill-side, while the flock is in the pen, and dies before morning-dawn.
Like a cloud, like one of many that were spread in impenetrable woof over the sky, which, when the shepherd north has driven its companions "to drink Antipodean noon," fades and dissolves in the clear ether--Such were we!
We left the fair margin of the beauteous lake of Geneva, and entered the Alpine ravines; tracing to its source the brawling Arve, through the rock-bound valley of Servox, beside the mighty waterfalls, and under the shadow of the inaccessible mountains, we
[1] Strange that we should seek shelter here!
Surely, if, in those countries where earth was wont, like a tender mother, to nourish her children, we had found her a destroyer, we need not seek it here, where stricken by keen penury she seems to shudder through her stony veins.
Nor were we mistaken in our conjecture.
We vainly sought the vast and ever moving glaciers of Chamounix, rifts of pendant ice, seas of congelated waters, the leafless groves of tempest-battered pines, dells, mere paths for the loud avalanche, and hill-tops, the resort of thunder-storms.
Pestilence reigned paramount even here.
By the time that day and night, like twin sisters of equal growth, shared equally their dominion over the hours, one by one, beneath the ice-caves, beside the waters springing from the thawed snows of a thousand winters, another and yet another of the
Yet we were not quite wrong in seeking a scene like this, whereon to close the drama.
Nature, true to the last, consoled us in the very heart of misery.
Sublime grandeur of outward objects soothed our hapless hearts, and were in harmony with our desolation.
Many sorrows have befallen man during his chequered course; and many a woe-stricken mourner has found himself sole survivor among many.
Our misery took its majestic shape and colouring from the vast ruin, that accompanied and made one with it.
Thus on lovely earth, many a dark ravine contains a brawling stream, shadowed by romantic rocks, threaded by mossy paths--but all, except this, wanted the mighty back-ground, the towering Alps, whose snowy capes, or bared ridges, lifted us from our dull
This solemn harmony of event and situation regulated our feelings, and gave as it were fitting costume to our last act.
Majestic gloom and tragic pomp attended the decease of wretched humanity.
The funeral procession of monarchs of old, was transcended by our splendid shews.
Near the sources of the Arveiron we performed the rites for, four only excepted, the last of the species.
Adrian and I, leaving Clara and Evelyn wrapt in peaceful unobserving slumber, carried the body to this desolate spot, and placed it in those caves of ice beneath the glacier, which rive and split with the slightest sound, and bring destruction on those
So, with hushed steps and in silence, we placed the dead on a bier of ice, and then, departing, stood on the rocky platform beside the river springs.
All hushed as we had been, the very striking of the air with our persons had sufficed to disturb the repose of this thawless region; and we had hardly left the cavern, before vast blocks of ice, detaching themselves from the roof, fell, and covered the
We had chosen a fair moonlight night, but our journey thither had been long, and the crescent sank behind the western heights by the time we had accomplished our purpose.
The snowy mountains and blue glaciers shone in their own light.
The rugged and abrupt ravine, which formed one side of Mont Anvert, was opposite to us, the glacier at our side; at our feet Arveiron, white and foaming, dashed over the pointed rocks that jutted into it, and, with whirring spray and ceaseless roar,
Yellow lightnings played around the vast dome of Mont Blanc, silent as the snow-clad rock they illuminated; all was bare, wild, and sublime, while the singing of the pines in melodious murmurings added a gentle interest to the rough magnificence.
Now the riving and fall of icy rocks clave the air; now the thunder of the avalanche burst on our ears.
In countries whose features are of less magnitude, nature betrays her living powers in the foliage of the trees, in the growth of herbage, in the soft purling of meandering streams; here, endowed with giant attributes, the torrent, the thunder-storm, and
Such the church-yard, such the requiem, such the eternal congregation, that waited on our companion's funeral!
Nor was it the human form alone which we had placed in this eternal sepulchre, whose obsequies we now celebrated.
With this last victim Plague vanished from the earth.
Death had never wanted weapons wherewith to destroy life, and we, few and weak as we had become, were still exposed to every other shaft with which his full quiver teemed.
But pestilence was absent from among them.
For seven years it had had full sway upon earth; she had trod every nook of our spacious globe; she had mingled with the atmosphere, which as a cloak enwraps all our fellow-creatures--the inhabitants of native Europe--the luxurious Asiatic--the swarthy
Her barbarous tyranny came to its close here in the rocky vale of Chamounix.
Still recurring scenes of misery and pain, the fruits of this distemper, made no more a part of our lives--the word plague no longer rung in our ears--the aspect of plague incarnate in the human countenance no longer appeared before our eyes.
From this moment I saw plague no more.
She abdicated her throne, and despoiled herself of her imperial sceptre among the ice rocks that surrounded us.
She left solitude and silence co-heirs of her kingdom.
My present feelings are so mingled with the past, that I cannot say whether the knowledge of this change visited us, as we stood on this sterile spot.
It seems to me that it did; that a cloud seemed to pass from over us, that a weight was taken from the air; that henceforth we breathed more freely, and raised our heads with some portion of former liberty.
Yet we did not hope.
We were impressed by the sentiment, that our race was run, but that plague would not be our destroyer.
The coming time was as a mighty river, down which a charmed boat is driven, whose mortal steersman knows, that the obvious peril is not the one he needs fear, yet that danger is nigh; and who floats awe-struck under beetling precipices, through the dark
What would become of us?
O for some Delphic oracle, or Pythian maid, to utter the secrets of futurity!
O for some Oedipus to solve the riddle of the cruel Sphynx!
Such Oedipus was I to be--not divining a word's juggle, but whose agonizing pangs, and sorrow-tainted life were to be the engines, wherewith to lay bare the secrets of destiny, and reveal the meaning of the enigma, whose explanation closed the history of
Dim fancies, akin to these, haunted our minds, and instilled feelings not unallied to pleasure, as we stood beside this silent tomb of nature, reared by these lifeless mountains, above her living veins, choking her vital principle.
"Thus are we left," said Adrian, "two melancholy blasted trees, where once a forest waved.
We are left to mourn, and pine, and die.
Yet even now we have our duties, which we must string ourselves to fulfil: the duty of bestowing pleasure where we can, and by force of love, irradiating with rainbow hues the tempest of grief.
Nor will I repine if in this extremity we preserve what we now possess.
Something tells me, Verney, that we need no longer dread our cruel enemy, and I cling with delight to the oracular voice.
Though strange, it will be sweet to mark the growth of your little boy, and the development of Clara's young heart.
In the midst of a desert world, we are everything to them; and, if we live, it must be our task to make this new mode of life happy to them.
At present this is easy, for their childish ideas do not wander into futurity, and the stinging craving for sympathy, and all of love of which our nature is susceptible, is not yet awake within them: we cannot guess what will happen then, when nature
We need only provide for the present, and endeavour to fill with pleasant images the inexperienced fancy of your lovely niece.
The scenes which now surround us, vast and sublime as they are, are not such as can best contribute to this work.
Nature is here like our fortunes, grand, but too destructive, bare, and rude, to be able to afford delight to her young imagination.
Let us descend to the sunny plains of Italy.
Winter will soon be here, to clothe this wilderness in double desolation; but we will cross the bleak hill-tops, and lead her to scenes of fertility and beauty, where her path will be adorned with flowers, and the cheery atmosphere inspire pleasure and
In pursuance of this plan we quitted Chamounix on the following day.
We had no cause to hasten our steps; no event was transacted beyond our actual sphere to enchain our resolves, so we yielded to every idle whim, and deemed our time well spent, when we could behold the passage of the hours without dismay.
We loitered along the lovely Vale of Servox; passed long hours on the bridge, which, crossing the ravine of Arve, commands a prospect of its pine-clothed depths, and the snowy mountains that wall it in.
We rambled through romantic Switzerland; till, fear of coming winter leading us forward, the first days of October found us in the valley of La Maurienne, which leads to Cenis.
I cannot explain the reluctance we felt at leaving this land of mountains; perhaps it was, that we regarded the Alps as boundaries between our former and our future state of existence, and so clung fondly to what of old we had loved.
Perhaps, because we had now so few impulses urging to a choice between two modes of action, we were pleased to preserve the existence of one, and preferred the prospect of what we were to do, to the recollection of what had been done.
We felt that for this year danger was past; and we believed that, for some months, we were secured to each other.
There was a thrilling, agonizing delight in the thought--it filled the eyes with misty tears, it tore the heart with tumultuous heavings; frailer than the "snow fall in the river," were we each and all--but we strove to give life and individuality to the
Thus tottering on the dizzy brink, we were happy.
Yes!
as we sat beneath the toppling rocks, beside the waterfalls, near --Forests, ancient as the hills, And folding sunny spots of greenery, where the chamois grazed, and the timid squirrel laid up its hoard--descanting on the charms of nature, drinking in the
Yet, O days of joy--days, when eye spoke to eye, and voices, sweeter than the music of the swinging branches of the pines, or rivulet's gentle murmur, answered mine--yet, O days replete with beatitude, days of loved society--days unutterably dear to me
Behold, how my streaming eyes blot this senseless paper--behold, how my features are convulsed by agonizing throes, at your mere recollection, now that, alone, my tears flow, my lips quiver, my cries fill the air, unseen, unmarked, unheard!
Yet, O yet, days of delight!
let me dwell on your long-drawn hours!
As the cold increased upon us, we passed the Alps, and descended into Italy.
At the uprising of morn, we sat at our repast, and cheated our regrets by gay sallies or learned disquisitions.
The live-long day we sauntered on, still keeping in view the end of our journey, but careless of the hour of its completion.
As the evening star shone out, and the orange sunset, far in the west, marked the position of the dear land we had for ever left, talk, thought enchaining, made the hours fly--O that we had lived thus for ever and for ever!
Of what consequence was it to our four hearts, that they alone were the fountains of life in the wide world?
As far as mere individual sentiment was concerned, we had rather be left thus united together, than if, each alone in a populous desert of unknown men, we had wandered truly companionless till life's last term.
In this manner, we endeavoured to console each other; in this manner, true philosophy taught us to reason.
It was the delight of Adrian and myself to wait on Clara, naming her the little queen of the world, ourselves her humblest servitors.
When we arrived at a town, our first care was to select for her its most choice abode; to make sure that no harrowing relic remained of its former inhabitants; to seek food for her, and minister to her wants with assiduous tenderness.
Clara entered into our scheme with childish gaiety.
Her chief business was to attend on Evelyn; but it was her sport to array herself in splendid robes, adorn herself with sunny gems, and ape a princely state.
Her religion, deep and pure, did not teach her to refuse to blunt thus the keen sting of regret; her youthful vivacity made her enter, heart and soul, into these strange masquerades.
We had resolved to pass the ensuing winter at Milan, which, as being a large and luxurious city, would afford us choice of homes.
We had descended the Alps, and left far behind their vast forests and mighty crags.
We entered smiling Italy.
Mingled grass and corn grew in her plains, the unpruned vines threw their luxuriant branches around the elms.
The grapes, overripe, had fallen on the ground, or hung purple, or burnished green, among the red and yellow leaves.
The ears of standing corn winnowed to emptiness by the spendthrift winds; the fallen foliage of the trees, the weed-grown brooks, the dusky olive, now spotted with its blackened fruit; the chestnuts, to which the squirrel only was harvest-man; all plenty,
all poverty, painted in wondrous hues and fantastic groupings this land of beauty.
In the towns, in the voiceless towns, we visited the churches, adorned by pictures, master-pieces of art, or galleries of statues--while in this genial clime the animals, in new found liberty, rambled through the gorgeous palaces, and hardly feared our
The dove-coloured oxen turned their full eyes on us, and paced slowly by; a startling throng of silly sheep, with pattering feet, would start up in some chamber, formerly dedicated to the repose of beauty, and rush, huddling past us, down the marble
We no longer started at these occurrences, nor at worse exhibition of change--when the palace had become a mere tomb, pregnant with fetid stench, strewn with the dead; and we could perceive how pestilence and fear had played strange antics, chasing the
We arrived at Milan, and stationed ourselves in the Vice-Roy's palace.
Here we made laws for ourselves, dividing our day, and fixing distinct occupations for each hour.
In the morning we rode in the adjoining country, or wandered through the palaces, in search of pictures or antiquities.
In the evening we assembled to read or to converse.
There were few books that we dared read; few, that did not cruelly deface the painting we bestowed on our solitude, by recalling combinations and emotions never more to be experienced by us.
Metaphysical disquisition; fiction, which wandering from all reality, lost itself in self-created errors; poets of times so far gone by, that to read of them was as to read of Atlantis and Utopia; or such as referred to nature only, and the workings of one
While we paused thus in our onward career towards death, time held on its accustomed course.
Still and for ever did the earth roll on, enthroned in her atmospheric car, speeded by the force of the invisible coursers of never-erring necessity.
And now, this dew-drop in the sky, this ball, ponderous with mountains, lucent with waves, passing from the short tyranny of watery Pisces and the frigid Ram, entered the radiant demesne of Taurus and the Twins.
There, fanned by vernal airs, the Spirit of Beauty sprung from her cold repose; and, with winnowing wings and soft pacing feet, set a girdle of verdure around the earth, sporting among the violets, hiding within the springing foliage of the trees, tripping
"For lo!
winter is past, the rain is over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; the fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines, with the tender grape, give a
[2] Thus was it in the time of the ancient regal poet; thus was it now.
Yet how could we miserable hail the approach of this delightful season?
We hoped indeed that death did not now as heretofore walk in its shadow; yet, left as we were alone to each other, we looked in each other's faces with enquiring eyes, not daring altogether to trust to our presentiments, and endeavouring to divine which
We were to pass the summer at the lake of Como, and thither we removed as soon as spring grew to her maturity, and the snow disappeared from the hill tops.
Ten miles from Como, under the steep heights of the eastern mountains, by the margin of the lake, was a villa called the Pliniana, from its being built on the site of a fountain, whose periodical ebb and flow is described by the younger Pliny in his
The house had nearly fallen into ruin, till in the year 2090, an English nobleman had bought it, and fitted it up with every luxury.
Two large halls, hung with splendid tapestry, and paved with marble, opened on each side of a court, of whose two other sides one overlooked the deep dark lake, and the other was bounded by a mountain, from whose stony side gushed, with roar and splash,
Above, underwood of myrtle and tufts of odorous plants crowned the rock, while the star-pointing giant cypresses reared themselves in the blue air, and the recesses of the hills were adorned with the luxuriant growth of chestnut-trees.
Here we fixed our summer residence.
We had a lovely skiff, in which we sailed, now stemming the midmost waves, now coasting the over-hanging and craggy banks, thick sown with evergreens, which dipped their shining leaves in the waters, and were mirrored in many a little bay and creek of
Here orange plants bloomed, here birds poured forth melodious hymns; and here, during spring, the cold snake emerged from the clefts, and basked on the sunny terraces of rock.
Were we not happy in this paradisiacal retreat?
If some kind spirit had whispered forgetfulness to us, methinks we should have been happy here, where the precipitous mountains, nearly pathless, shut from our view the far fields of desolate earth, and with small exertion of the imagination, we might
Not one among us enjoyed the beauty of this scenery so much as Clara.
Before we quitted Milan, a change had taken place in her habits and manners.
She lost her gaiety, she laid aside her sports, and assumed an almost vestal plainness of attire.
She shunned us, retiring with Evelyn to some distant chamber or silent nook; nor did she enter into his pastimes with the same zest as she was wont, but would sit and watch him with sadly tender smiles, and eyes bright with tears, yet without a word of
She approached us timidly, avoided our caresses, nor shook off her embarrassment till some serious discussion or lofty theme called her for awhile out of herself.
Her beauty grew as a rose, which, opening to the summer wind, discloses leaf after leaf till the sense aches with its excess of loveliness.
A slight and variable colour tinged her cheeks, and her motions seemed attuned by some hidden harmony of surpassing sweetness.
We redoubled our tenderness and earnest attentions.
She received them with grateful smiles, that fled swift as sunny beam from a glittering wave on an April day.
Our only acknowledged point of sympathy with her, appeared to be Evelyn.
This dear little fellow was a comforter and delight to us beyond all words.
His buoyant spirit, and his innocent ignorance of our vast calamity, were balm to us, whose thoughts and feelings were over-wrought and spun out in the immensity of speculative sorrow.
To cherish, to caress, to amuse him was the common task of all.
Clara, who felt towards him in some degree like a young mother, gratefully acknowledged our kindness towards him.
To me, O!
to me, who saw the clear brows and soft eyes of the beloved of my heart, my lost and ever dear Idris, re-born in his gentle face, to me he was dear even to pain; if I pressed him to my heart, methought I clasped a real and living part of her, who had lain
It was the custom of Adrian and myself to go out each day in our skiff to forage in the adjacent country.
In these expeditions we were seldom accompanied by Clara or her little charge, but our return was an hour of hilarity.
Evelyn ransacked our stores with childish eagerness, and we always brought some new found gift for our fair companion.
Then too we made discoveries of lovely scenes or gay palaces, whither in the evening we all proceeded.
Our sailing expeditions were most divine, and with a fair wind or transverse course we cut the liquid waves; and, if talk failed under the pressure of thought, I had my clarionet with me, which awoke the echoes, and gave the change to our careful minds.
Clara at such times often returned to her former habits of free converse and gay sally; and though our four hearts alone beat in the world, those four hearts were happy.
One day, on our return from the town of Como, with a laden boat, we expected as usual to be met at the port by Clara and Evelyn, and we were somewhat surprised to see the beach vacant.
I, as my nature prompted, would not prognosticate evil, but explained it away as a mere casual incident.
Not so Adrian.
He was seized with sudden trembling and apprehension, and he called to me with vehemence to steer quickly for land, and, when near, leapt from the boat, half falling into the water; and, scrambling up the steep bank, hastened along the narrow strip of
I followed without delay; the garden and inner court were empty, so was the house, whose every room we visited.
Adrian called loudly upon Clara's name, and was about to rush up the near mountain-path, when the door of a summer-house at the end of the garden slowly opened, and Clara appeared, not advancing towards us, but leaning against a column of the building with
Adrian sprang towards her with a cry of joy, and folded her delightedly in his arms.
She withdrew from his embrace, and, without a word, again entered the summer-house.
Her quivering lips, her despairing heart refused to afford her voice to express our misfortune.
Poor little Evelyn had, while playing with her, been seized with sudden fever, and now lay torpid and speechless on a little couch in the summer-house.
For a whole fortnight we unceasingly watched beside the poor child, as his life declined under the ravages of a virulent typhus.
His little form and tiny lineaments encaged the embryo of the world-spanning mind of man.
Man's nature, brimful of passions and affections, would have had an home in that little heart, whose swift pulsations hurried towards their close.
His small hand's fine mechanism, now flaccid and unbent, would in the growth of sinew and muscle, have achieved works of beauty or of strength.
His tender rosy feet would have trod in firm manhood the bowers and glades of earth-- these reflections were now of little use: he lay, thought and strength suspended, waiting unresisting the final blow.
We watched at his bedside, and when the access of fever was on him, we neither spoke nor looked at each other, marking only his obstructed breath and the mortal glow that tinged his sunken cheek, the heavy death that weighed on his eyelids.
It is a trite evasion to say, that words could not express our long drawn agony; yet how can words image sensations, whose tormenting keenness throw us back, as it were, on the deep roots and hidden foundations of our nature, which shake our being with
I have called that period a fortnight, which we passed watching the changes of the sweet child's malady--and such it might have been--at night, we wondered to find another day gone, while each particular hour seemed endless.
Day and night were exchanged for one another uncounted; we slept hardly at all, nor did we even quit his room, except when a pang of grief seized us, and we retired from each other for a short period to conceal our sobs and tears.
We endeavoured in vain to abstract Clara from this deplorable scene.
She sat, hour after hour, looking at him, now softly arranging his pillow, and, while he had power to swallow, administered his drink.
At length the moment of his death came: the blood paused in its flow --his eyes opened, and then closed again: without convulsion or sigh, the frail tenement was left vacant of its spiritual inhabitant.
I have heard that the sight of the dead has confirmed materialists in their belief.
I ever felt otherwise.
Was that my child--that moveless decaying inanimation?
My child was enraptured by my caresses; his dear voice cloathed with meaning articulations his thoughts, otherwise inaccessible; his smile was a ray of the soul, and the same soul sat upon its throne in his eyes.
I turn from this mockery of what he was.
Take, O earth, thy debt!
freely and for ever I consign to thee the garb thou didst afford.
But thou, sweet child, amiable and beloved boy, either thy spirit has sought a fitter dwelling, or, shrined in my heart, thou livest while it lives.
We placed his remains under a cypress, the upright mountain being scooped out to receive them.
And then Clara said, "If you wish me to live, take me from hence.
There is something in this scene of transcendent beauty, in these trees, and hills and waves, that for ever whisper to me, leave thy cumbrous flesh, and make a part of us.
I earnestly entreat you to take me away".
So on the fifteenth of August we bade adieu to our villa, and the embowering shades of this abode of beauty; to calm bay and noisy waterfall; to Evelyn's little grave we bade farewell!
and then, with heavy hearts, we departed on our pilgrimage towards Rome.

CHAPTER IX.
NOW--soft awhile--have I arrived so near the end?
Yes!
it is all over now--a step or two over those new made graves, and the wearisome way is done.
Can I accomplish my task?
Can I streak my paper with words capacious of the grand conclusion?
Arise, black Melancholy!
quit thy Cimmerian solitude!
Bring with thee murky fogs from hell, which may drink up the day; bring blight and pestiferous exhalations, which, entering the hollow caverns and breathing places of earth, may fill her stony veins with corruption, so that not only herbage may no longer
Do this, sad visaged power, while I write, while eyes read these pages.
And who will read them?
Beware, tender offspring of the re-born world-- beware, fair being, with human heart, yet untamed by care, and human brow, yet unploughed by time--beware, lest the cheerful current of thy blood be checked, thy golden locks turn grey, thy sweet dimpling
Let not day look on these lines, lest garish day waste, turn pale, and die.
Seek a cypress grove, whose moaning boughs will be harmony befitting; seek some cave, deep embowered in earth's dark entrails, where no light will penetrate, save that which struggles, red and flickering, through a single fissure, staining thy page with
There is a painful confusion in my brain, which refuses to delineate distinctly succeeding events.
Sometimes the irradiation of my friend's gentle smile comes before me; and methinks its light spans and fills eternity--then, again, I feel the gasping throes-- We quitted Como, and in compliance with Adrian's earnest desire, we took Venice in our way to
There was something to the English peculiarly attractive in the idea of this wave-encircled, island-enthroned city.
Adrian had never seen it.
We went down the Po and the Brenta in a boat; and, the days proving intolerably hot, we rested in the bordering palaces during the day, travelling through the night, when darkness made the bordering banks indistinct, and our solitude less remarkable; when
Clara, long overcome by excessive grief, had to a great degree cast aside her timid, cold reserve, and received our attentions with grateful tenderness.
While Adrian with poetic fervour discoursed of the glorious nations of the dead, of the beauteous earth and the fate of man, she crept near him, drinking in his speech with silent pleasure.
We banished from our talk, and as much as possible from our thoughts, the knowledge of our desolation.
And it would be incredible to an inhabitant of cities, to one among a busy throng, to what extent we succeeded.
It was as a man confined in a dungeon, whose small and grated rift at first renders the doubtful light more sensibly obscure, till, the visual orb having drunk in the beam, and adapted itself to its scantiness, he finds that clear noon inhabits his cell.
So we, a simple triad on empty earth, were multiplied to each other, till we became all in all.
We stood like trees, whose roots are loosened by the wind, which support one another, leaning and clinging with encreased fervour while the wintry storms howl.
Thus we floated down the widening stream of the Po, sleeping when the cicale sang, awake with the stars.
We entered the narrower banks of the Brenta, and arrived at the shore of the Laguna at sunrise on the sixth of September.
The bright orb slowly rose from behind its cupolas and towers, and shed its penetrating light upon the glassy waters.
Wrecks of gondolas, and some few uninjured ones, were strewed on the beach at Fusina.
We embarked in one of these for the widowed daughter of ocean, who, abandoned and fallen, sat forlorn on her propping isles, looking towards the far mountains of Greece.
We rowed lightly over the Laguna, and entered Canale Grande.
The tide ebbed sullenly from out the broken portals and violated halls of Venice: sea weed and sea monsters were left on the blackened marble, while the salt ooze defaced the matchless works of art that adorned their walls, and the sea gull flew out from
In the midst of this appalling ruin of the monuments of man's power, nature asserted her ascendancy, and shone more beauteous from the contrast.
The radiant waters hardly trembled, while the rippling waves made many sided mirrors to the sun; the blue immensity, seen beyond Lido, stretched far, unspecked by boat, so tranquil, so lovely, that it seemed to invite us to quit the land strewn with ruins,
We saw the ruins of this hapless city from the height of the tower of San Marco, immediately under us, and turned with sickening hearts to the sea, which, though it be a grave, rears no monument, discloses no ruin.
Evening had come apace.
The sun set in calm majesty behind the misty summits of the Apennines, and its golden and roseate hues painted the mountains of the opposite shore.
"That land," said Adrian, "tinged with the last glories of the day, is Greece".
Greece!
The sound had a responsive chord in the bosom of Clara.
She vehemently reminded us that we had promised to take her once again to Greece, to the tomb of her parents.
Why go to Rome?
what should we do at Rome?
We might take one of the many vessels to be found here, embark in it, and steer right for Albania.
I objected the dangers of ocean, and the distance of the mountains we saw, from Athens; a distance which, from the savage uncultivation of the country, was almost impassable.
Adrian, who was delighted with Clara's proposal, obviated these objections.
The season was favourable; the north-west that blew would take us transversely across the gulph; and then we might find, in some abandoned port, a light Greek caique, adapted for such navigation, and run down the coast of the Morea, and, passing over the
This appeared to me wild talk; but the sea, glowing with a thousand purple hues, looked so brilliant and safe; my beloved companions were so earnest, so determined, that, when Adrian said, "Well, though it is not exactly what you wish, yet consent, to
That evening we selected a vessel, whose size just seemed fitted for our enterprize; we bent the sails and put the rigging in order, and reposing that night in one of the city's thousand palaces, agreed to embark at sunrise the following morning.
When winds that move not its calm surface, sweep The azure sea, I love the land no more; The smiles of the serene and tranquil deep Tempt my unquiet mind-- Thus said Adrian, quoting a translation of Moschus's poem, as in the clear morning light, we rowed
The laughing morning air filled them, while sun-light bathed earth, sky and ocean--the placid waves divided to receive our keel, and playfully kissed the dark sides of our little skiff, murmuring a welcome; as land receded, still the blue expanse, most
As the air and waters were tranquil and balmy, so were our minds steeped in quiet.
In comparison with the unstained deep, funereal earth appeared a grave, its high rocks and stately mountains were but monuments, its trees the plumes of a herse, the brooks and rivers brackish with tears for departed man.
Farewell to desolate towns --to fields with their savage intermixture of corn and weeds--to ever multiplying relics of our lost species.
Ocean, we commit ourselves to thee --even as the patriarch of old floated above the drowned world, let us be saved, as thus we betake ourselves to thy perennial flood.
Adrian sat at the helm; I attended to the rigging, the breeze right aft filled our swelling canvas, and we ran before it over the untroubled deep.
The wind died away at noon; its idle breath just permitted us to hold our course.
As lazy, fair-weather sailors, careless of the coming hour, we talked gaily of our coasting voyage, of our arrival at Athens.
We would make our home of one of the Cyclades, and there in myrtle-groves, amidst perpetual spring, fanned by the wholesome sea-breezes--we would live long years in beatific union--Was there such a thing as death in the world?
-- The sun passed its zenith, and lingered down the stainless floor of heaven.
Lying in the boat, my face turned up to the sky, I thought I saw on its blue white, marbled streaks, so slight, so immaterial, that now I said-- They are there--and now, It is a mere imagination.
A sudden fear stung me while I gazed; and, starting up, and running to the prow,--as I stood, my hair was gently lifted on my brow--a dark line of ripples appeared to the east, gaining rapidly on us--my breathless remark to Adrian, was followed by the
Behold us now in our frail tenement, hemmed in by hungry, roaring waves, buffeted by winds.
In the inky east two vast clouds, sailing contrary ways, met; the lightning leapt forth, and the hoarse thunder muttered.
Again in the south, the clouds replied, and the forked stream of fire running along the black sky, shewed us the appalling piles of clouds, now met and obliterated by the heaving waves.
Great God!
And we alone--we three-- alone--alone--sole dwellers on the sea and on the earth, we three must perish!
The vast universe, its myriad worlds, and the plains of boundless earth which we had left--the extent of shoreless sea around--contracted to my view--they and all that they contained, shrunk up to one point, even to our tossing bark, freighted with
A convulsion of despair crossed the love-beaming face of Adrian, while with set teeth he murmured, "Yet they shall be saved"!
Clara, visited by an human pang, pale and trembling, crept near him--he looked on her with an encouraging smile--"Do you fear, sweet girl?
O, do not fear, we shall soon be on shore"!
The darkness prevented me from seeing the changes of her countenance; but her voice was clear and sweet, as she replied, "Why should I fear?
neither sea nor storm can harm us, if mighty destiny or the ruler of destiny does not permit.
And then the stinging fear of surviving either of you, is not here--one death will clasp us undivided".
Meanwhile we took in all our sails, save a gib; and, as soon as we might without danger, changed our course, running with the wind for the Italian shore.
Dark night mixed everything; we hardly discerned the white crests of the murderous surges, except when lightning made brief noon, and drank the darkness, shewing us our danger, and restoring us to double night.
We were all silent, except when Adrian, as steersman, made an encouraging observation.
Our little shell obeyed the rudder miraculously well, and ran along on the top of the waves, as if she had been an offspring of the sea, and the angry mother sheltered her endangered child.
I sat at the prow, watching our course; when suddenly I heard the waters break with redoubled fury.
We were certainly near the shore--at the same time I cried, "About there"!
and a broad lightning filling the concave, shewed us for one moment the level beach a-head, disclosing even the sands, and stunted, ooze-sprinkled beds of reeds, that grew at high water mark.
Again it was dark, and we drew in our breath with such content as one may, who, while fragments of volcano-hurled rock darken the air, sees a vast mass ploughing the ground immediately at his feet.
What to do we knew not --the breakers here, there, everywhere, encompassed us--they roared, and dashed, and flung their hated spray in our faces.
With considerable difficulty and danger we succeeded at length in altering our course, and stretched out from shore.
I urged my companions to prepare for the wreck of our little skiff, and to bind themselves to some oar or spar which might suffice to float them.
I was myself an excellent swimmer--the very sight of the sea was wont to raise in me such sensations, as a huntsman experiences, when he hears a pack of hounds in full cry; I loved to feel the waves wrap me and strive to overpower me; while I, lord of
Adrian also could swim--but the weakness of his frame prevented him from feeling pleasure in the exercise, or acquiring any great expertness.
But what power could the strongest swimmer oppose to the overpowering violence of ocean in its fury?
My efforts to prepare my companions were rendered nearly futile --for the roaring breakers prevented our hearing one another speak, and the waves, that broke continually over our boat, obliged me to exert all my strength in lading the water out, as fast as
The while darkness, palpable and rayless, hemmed us round, dissipated only by the lightning; sometimes we beheld thunderbolts, fiery red, fall into the sea, and at intervals vast spouts stooped from the clouds, churning the wild ocean, which rose to meet
Our gunwales had been torn away, our single sail had been rent to ribbands, and borne down the stream of the wind.
We had cut away our mast, and lightened the boat of all she contained--Clara attempted to assist me in heaving the water from the hold, and, as she turned her eyes to look on the lightning, I could discern by that momentary gleam, that resignation had
We have a power given us in any worst extremity, which props the else feeble mind of man, and enables us to endure the most savage tortures with a stillness of soul which in hours of happiness we could not have imagined.
A calm, more dreadful in truth than the tempest, allayed the wild beatings of my heart--a calm like that of the gamester, the suicide, and the murderer, when the last die is on the point of being cast--while the poisoned cup is at the lips,--as the
Hours passed thus--hours which might write old age on the face of beardless youth, and grizzle the silky hair of infancy---hours, while the chaotic uproar continued, while each dread gust transcended in fury the one before, and our skiff hung on the
For a moment the gale paused, and ocean sank to comparative silence--it was a breathless interval; the wind which, as a practised leaper, had gathered itself up before it sprung, now with terrific roar rushed over the sea, and the waves struck our stern.
Adrian exclaimed that the rudder was gone;--"We are lost," cried Clara, "Save yourselves--O save yourselves"!
The lightning shewed me the poor girl half buried in the water at the bottom of the boat; as she was sinking in it Adrian caught her up, and sustained her in his arms.
We were without a rudder--we rushed prow foremost into the vast billows piled up a-head-- they broke over and filled the tiny skiff; one scream I heard--one cry that we were gone, I uttered; I found myself in the waters; darkness was around.
When the light of the tempest flashed, I saw the keel of our upset boat close to me--I clung to this, grasping it with clenched hand and nails, while I endeavoured during each flash to discover any appearance of my companions.
I thought I saw Adrian at no great distance from me, clinging to an oar; I sprung from my hold, and with energy beyond my human strength, I dashed aside the waters as I strove to lay hold of him.
As that hope failed, instinctive love of life animated me, and feelings of contention, as if a hostile will combated with mine.
I breasted the surges, and flung them from me, as I would the opposing front and sharpened claws of a lion about to enfang my bosom.
When I had been beaten down by one wave, I rose on another, while I felt bitter pride curl my lip.
Ever since the storm had carried us near the shore, we had never attained any great distance from it.
With every flash I saw the bordering coast; yet the progress I made was small, while each wave, as it receded, carried me back into ocean's far abysses.
At one moment I felt my foot touch the sand, and then again I was in deep water; my arms began to lose their power of motion; my breath failed me under the influence of the strangling waters-- a thousand wild and delirious thoughts crossed me: as well as I
I rose, and was again thrown down by the breakers--a point of rock to which I was enabled to cling, gave me a moment's respite; and then, taking advantage of the ebbing of the waves, I ran forwards-- gained the dry sands, and fell senseless on the oozy
I must have lain long deprived of life; for when first, with a sickening feeling, I unclosed my eyes, the light of morning met them.
Great change had taken place meanwhile: grey dawn dappled the flying clouds, which sped onwards, leaving visible at intervals vast lakes of pure ether.
A fountain of light arose in an encreasing stream from the east, behind the waves of the Adriatic, changing the grey to a roseate hue, and then flooding sky and sea with aerial gold.
A kind of stupor followed my fainting; my senses were alive, but memory was extinct.
The blessed respite was short--a snake lurked near me to sting me into life--on the first retrospective emotion I would have started up, but my limbs refused to obey me; my knees trembled, the muscles had lost all power.
I still believed that I might find one of my beloved companions cast like me, half alive, on the beach; and I strove in every way to restore my frame to the use of its animal functions.
I wrung the brine from my hair; and the rays of the risen sun soon visited me with genial warmth.
With the restoration of my bodily powers, my mind became in some degree aware of the universe of misery, henceforth to be its dwelling.
I ran to the water's edge, calling on the beloved names.
Ocean drank in, and absorbed my feeble voice, replying with pitiless roar.
I climbed a near tree: the level sands bounded by a pine forest, and the sea clipped round by the horizon, was all that I could discern.
In vain I extended my researches along the beach; the mast we had thrown overboard, with tangled cordage, and remnants of a sail, was the sole relic land received of our wreck.
Sometimes I stood still, and wrung my hands.
I accused earth and sky --the universal machine and the Almighty power that misdirected it.
Again I threw myself on the sands, and then the sighing wind, mimicking a human cry, roused me to bitter, fallacious hope.
Assuredly if any little bark or smallest canoe had been near, I should have sought the savage plains of ocean, found the dear remains of my lost ones, and clinging round them, have shared their grave.
The day passed thus; each moment contained eternity; although when hour after hour had gone by, I wondered at the quick flight of time.
Yet even now I had not drunk the bitter potion to the dregs; I was not yet persuaded of my loss; I did not yet feel in every pulsation, in every nerve, in every thought, that I remained alone of my race,--that I was the LAST MAN.
The day had clouded over, and a drizzling rain set in at sunset.
Even the eternal skies weep, I thought; is there any shame then, that mortal man should spend himself in tears?
I remembered the ancient fables, in which human beings are described as dissolving away through weeping into ever-gushing fountains.
Ah!
that so it were; and then my destiny would be in some sort akin to the watery death of Adrian and Clara.
Oh!
grief is fantastic; it weaves a web on which to trace the history of its woe from every form and change around; it incorporates itself with all living nature; it finds sustenance in every object; as light, it fills all things, and, like light, it gives its
I had wandered in my search to some distance from the spot on which I had been cast, and came to one of those watch-towers, which at stated distances line the Italian shore.
I was glad of shelter, glad to find a work of human hands, after I had gazed so long on nature's drear barrenness; so I entered, and ascended the rough winding staircase into the guard-room.
So far was fate kind, that no harrowing vestige remained of its former inhabitants; a few planks laid across two iron tressels, and strewed with the dried leaves of Indian corn, was the bed presented to me; and an open chest, containing some half mouldered
Thirst also, violent and parching, the result of the sea-water I had drank, and of the exhaustion of my frame, tormented me.
Kind nature had gifted the supply of these wants with pleasurable sensations, so that I--even I!
--was refreshed and calmed, as I ate of this sorry fare, and drank a little of the sour wine which half filled a flask left in this abandoned dwelling.
Then I stretched myself on the bed, not to be disdained by the victim of shipwreck.
The earthy smell of the dried leaves was balm to my sense after the hateful odour of sea-weed.
I forgot my state of loneliness.
I neither looked backward nor forward; my senses were hushed to repose; I fell asleep and dreamed of all dear inland scenes, of hay-makers, of the shepherd's whistle to his dog, when he demanded his help to drive the flock to fold; of sights and sounds
I awoke in a painful agony--for I fancied that ocean, breaking its bounds, carried away the fixed continent and deep rooted mountains, together with the streams I loved, the woods, and the flocks--it raged around, with that continued and dreadful roar
As my waking sense returned, the bare walls of the guard room closed round me, and the rain pattered against the single window.
How dreadful it is, to emerge from the oblivion of slumber, and to receive as a good morrow the mute wailing of one's own hapless heart --to return from the land of deceptive dreams, to the heavy knowledge of unchanged disaster!
--Thus was it with me, now, and for ever!
The sting of other griefs might be blunted by time; and even mine yielded sometimes during the day, to the pleasure inspired by the imagination or the senses; but I never look first upon the morning-light but with my fingers pressed tight on my bursting
Now I awoke for the first time in the dead world--I awoke alone--and the dull dirge of the sea, heard even amidst the rain, recalled me to the reflection of the wretch I had become.
The sound came like a reproach, a scoff--like the sting of remorse in the soul--I gasped--the veins and muscles of my throat swelled, suffocating me.
I put my fingers to my ears, I buried my head in the leaves of my couch, I would have dived to the centre to lose hearing of that hideous moan.
But another task must be mine--again I visited the detested beach-- again I vainly looked far and wide--again I raised my unanswered cry, lifting up the only voice that could ever again force the mute air to syllable the human thought.
What a pitiable, forlorn, disconsolate being I was!
My very aspect and garb told the tale of my despair.
My hair was matted and wild--my limbs soiled with salt ooze; while at sea, I had thrown off those of my garments that encumbered me, and the rain drenched the thin summer-clothing I had retained--my feet were bare, and the stunted reeds and broken shells
For a moment I compared myself to that monarch of the waste--Robinson Crusoe.
We had been both thrown companionless--he on the shore of a desolate island: I on that of a desolate world.
I was rich in the so called goods of life.
If I turned my steps from the near barren scene, and entered any of the earth's million cities, I should find their wealth stored up for my accommodation--clothes, food, books, and a choice of dwelling beyond the command of the princes of former
--Viewing the question thus, who would not have preferred the Sybarite enjoyments I could command, the philosophic leisure, and ample intellectual resources, to his life of labour and peril?
Yet he was far happier than I: for he could hope, nor hope in vain--the destined vessel at last arrived, to bear him to countrymen and kindred, where the events of his solitude became a fire-side tale.
To none could I ever relate the story of my adversity; no hope had I. He knew that, beyond the ocean which begirt his lonely island, thousands lived whom the sun enlightened when it shone also on him: beneath the meridian sun and visiting moon, I alone
He had fled from his fellows, and was transported with terror at the print of a human foot.
I would have knelt down and worshipped the same.
The wild and cruel Caribbee, the merciless Cannibal--or worse than these, the uncouth, brute, and remorseless veteran in the vices of civilization, would have been to me a beloved companion, a treasure dearly prized--his nature would be kin to mine; his
It cannot be that I shall never behold a fellow being more!
--never!
--never!
--not in the course of years!
--Shall I wake, and speak to none, pass the interminable hours, my soul, islanded in the world, a solitary point, surrounded by vacuum?
Will day follow day endlessly thus?
--No!
no!
a God rules the world--providence has not exchanged its golden sceptre for an aspic's sting.
Away!
let me fly from the ocean-grave, let me depart from this barren nook, paled in, as it is, from access by its own desolateness; let me tread once again the paved towns; step over the threshold of man's dwellings, and most certainly I shall find this thought
I entered Ravenna, (the town nearest to the spot whereon I had been cast), before the second sun had set on the empty world; I saw many living creatures; oxen, and horses, and dogs, but there was no man among them; I entered a cottage, it was vacant; I
Every house had its inmate; but I could not perceive them.
If I could have deluded myself into a belief of this kind, I should have been far more satisfied.
But my brain, tenacious of its reason, refused to lend itself to such imaginations--and though I endeavoured to play the antic to myself, I knew that I, the offspring of man, during long years one among many--now remained sole survivor of my species.
The sun sank behind the western hills; I had fasted since the preceding evening, but, though faint and weary, I loathed food, nor ceased, while yet a ray of light remained, to pace the lonely streets.
Night came on, and sent every living creature but me to the bosom of its mate.
It was my solace, to blunt my mental agony by personal hardship--of the thousand beds around, I would not seek the luxury of one; I lay down on the pavement,--a cold marble step served me for a pillow--midnight came; and then, though not before, did my
Thus I passed the second night of my desolation.
CHAPTER X. I AWOKE in the morning, just as the higher windows of the lofty houses received the first beams of the rising sun.
The birds were chirping, perched on the windows sills and deserted thresholds of the doors.
I awoke, and my first thought was, Adrian and Clara are dead.
I no longer shall be hailed by their good-morrow--or pass the long day in their society.
I shall never see them more.
The ocean has robbed me of them--stolen their hearts of love from their breasts, and given over to corruption what was dearer to me than light, or life, or hope.
I was an untaught shepherd-boy, when Adrian deigned to confer on me his friendship.
The best years of my life had been passed with him.
All I had possessed of this world's goods, of happiness, knowledge, or virtue--I owed to him.
He had, in his person, his intellect, and rare qualities, given a glory to my life, which without him it had never known.
Beyond all other beings he had taught me, that goodness, pure and single, can be an attribute of man.
It was a sight for angels to congregate to behold, to view him lead, govern, and solace, the last days of the human race.
My lovely Clara also was lost to me--she who last of the daughters of man, exhibited all those feminine and maiden virtues, which poets, painters, and sculptors, have in their various languages strove to express.
Yet, as far as she was concerned, could I lament that she was removed in early youth from the certain advent of misery?
Pure she was of soul, and all her intents were holy.
But her heart was the throne of love, and the sensibility her lovely countenance expressed, was the prophet of many woes, not the less deep and drear, because she would have for ever concealed them.
These two wondrously endowed beings had been spared from the universal wreck, to be my companions during the last year of solitude.
I had felt, while they were with me, all their worth.
I was conscious that every other sentiment, regret, or passion had by degrees merged into a yearning, clinging affection for them.
I had not forgotten the sweet partner of my youth, mother of my children, my adored Idris; but I saw at least a part of her spirit alive again in her brother; and after, that by Evelyn's death I had lost what most dearly recalled her to me; I enshrined her
I sound the depths of my heart, and try in vain to draw thence the expressions that can typify my love for these remnants of my race.
If regret and sorrow came athwart me, as well it might in our solitary and uncertain state, the clear tones of Adrian's voice, and his fervent look, dissipated the gloom; or I was cheered unaware by the mild content and sweet resignation Clara's cloudless
They were all to me--the suns of my benighted soul--repose in my weariness--slumber in my sleepless woe.
Ill, most ill, with disjointed words, bare and weak, have I expressed the feeling with which I clung to them.
I would have wound myself like ivy inextricably round them, so that the same blow might destroy us.
I would have entered and been a part of them--so that If the dull substance of my flesh were thought, even now I had accompanied them to their new and incommunicable abode.
Never shall I see them more.
I am bereft of their dear converse--bereft of sight of them.
I am a tree rent by lightning; never will the bark close over the bared fibres--never will their quivering life, torn by the winds, receive the opiate of a moment's balm.
I am alone in the world-- but that expression as yet was less pregnant with misery, than that Adrian and Clara are dead.
The tide of thought and feeling rolls on for ever the same, though the banks and shapes around, which govern its course, and the reflection in the wave, vary.
Thus the sentiment of immediate loss in some sort decayed, while that of utter, irremediable loneliness grew on me with time.
Three days I wandered through Ravenna--now thinking only of the beloved beings who slept in the oozy caves of ocean--now looking forward on the dread blank before me; shuddering to make an onward step--writhing at each change that marked the progress of
For three days I wandered to and fro in this melancholy town.
I passed whole hours in going from house to house, listening whether I could detect some lurking sign of human existence.
Sometimes I rang at a bell; it tinkled through the vaulted rooms, and silence succeeded to the sound.
I called myself hopeless, yet still I hoped; and still disappointment ushered in the hours, intruding the cold, sharp steel which first pierced me, into the aching festering wound.
I fed like a wild beast, which seizes its food only when stung by intolerable hunger.
I did not change my garb, or seek the shelter of a roof, during all those days.
Burning heats, nervous irritation, a ceaseless, but confused flow of thought, sleepless nights, and days instinct with a frenzy of agitation, possessed me during that time.
As the fever of my blood encreased, a desire of wandering came upon me.
I remember, that the sun had set on the fifth day after my wreck, when, without purpose or aim, I quitted the town of Ravenna.
I must have been very ill.
Had I been possessed by more or less of delirium, that night had surely been my last; for, as I continued to walk on the banks of the Mantone, whose upward course I followed, I looked wistfully on the stream, acknowledging to myself that its pellucid waves
I walked a considerable part of the night, and excessive weariness at length conquered my repugnance to the availing myself of the deserted habitations of my species.
The waning moon, which had just risen, shewed me a cottage, whose neat entrance and trim garden reminded me of my own England.
I lifted up the latch of the door and entered.
A kitchen first presented itself, where, guided by the moon beams, I found materials for striking a light.
Within this was a bed room; the couch was furnished with sheets of snowy whiteness; the wood piled on the hearth, and an array as for a meal, might almost have deceived me into the dear belief that I had here found what I had so long sought--one survivor,
I steeled myself against the delusion; the room itself was vacant: it was only prudent, I repeated to myself, to examine the rest of the house.
I fancied that I was proof against the expectation; yet my heart beat audibly, as I laid my hand on the lock of each door, and it sunk again, when I perceived in each the same vacancy.
Dark and silent they were as vaults; so I returned to the first chamber, wondering what sightless host had spread the materials for my repast, and my repose.
I drew a chair to the table, and examined what the viands were of which I was to partake.
In truth it was a death feast!
The bread was blue and mouldy; the cheese lay a heap of dust.
I did not dare examine the other dishes; a troop of ants passed in a double line across the table cloth; every utensil was covered with dust, with cobwebs, and myriads of dead flies: these were objects each and all betokening the fallaciousness of my
Tears rushed into my eyes; surely this was a wanton display of the power of the destroyer.
What had I done, that each sensitive nerve was thus to be anatomized?
Yet why complain more now than ever?
This vacant cottage revealed no new sorrow-- the world was empty; mankind was dead--I knew it well--why quarrel therefore with an acknowledged and stale truth?
Yet, as I said, I had hoped in the very heart of despair, so that every new impression of the hard-cut reality on my soul brought with it a fresh pang, telling me the yet unstudied lesson, that neither change of place nor time could bring alleviation to my
I hardly dared conjecture what space of time that expression implied.
It is true, I was no longer in the first blush of manhood; neither had I declined far in the vale of years--men have accounted mine the prime of life: I had just entered my thirty-seventh year; every limb was as well knit, every articulation as true, as
Such were the reflections that ushered in my slumber on that night.
The shelter, however, and less disturbed repose which I enjoyed, restored me the following morning to a greater portion of health and strength, than I had experienced since my fatal shipwreck.
Among the stores I had discovered on searching the cottage the preceding night, was a quantity of dried grapes; these refreshed me in the morning, as I left my lodging and proceeded towards a town which I discerned at no great distance.
As far as I could divine, it must have been Forli.
I entered with pleasure its wide and grassy streets.
All, it is true, pictured the excess of desolation; yet I loved to find myself in those spots which had been the abode of my fellow creatures.
I delighted to traverse street after street, to look up at the tall houses, and repeat to myself, once they contained beings similar to myself--I was not always the wretch I am now.
The wide square of Forli, the arcade around it, its light and pleasant aspect cheered me.
I was pleased with the idea, that, if the earth should be again peopled, we, the lost race, would, in the relics left behind, present no contemptible exhibition of our powers to the new comers.
I entered one of the palaces, and opened the door of a magnificent saloon.
I started--I looked again with renewed wonder.
What wild-looking, unkempt, half-naked savage was that before me?
The surprise was momentary.
I perceived that it was I myself whom I beheld in a large mirror at the end of the hall.
No wonder that the lover of the princely Idris should fail to recognize himself in the miserable object there pourtrayed.
My tattered dress was that in which I had crawled half alive from the tempestuous sea.
My long and tangled hair hung in elf locks on my brow--my dark eyes, now hollow and wild, gleamed from under them--my cheeks were discoloured by the jaundice, which (the effect of misery and neglect) suffused my skin, and were half hid by a beard of many
Yet why should I not remain thus, I thought; the world is dead, and this squalid attire is a fitter mourning garb than the foppery of a black suit.
And thus, methinks, I should have remained, had not hope, without which I do not believe man could exist, whispered to me, that, in such a plight, I should be an object of fear and aversion to the being, preserved I knew not where, but I fondly trusted, at
Will my readers scorn the vanity, that made me attire myself with some care, for the sake of this visionary being?
Or will they forgive the freaks of a half crazed imagination?
I can easily forgive myself--for hope, however vague, was so dear to me, and a sentiment of pleasure of so rare occurrence, that I yielded readily to any idea, that cherished the one, or promised any recurrence of the former to my sorrowing heart.
After such occupation, I visited every street, alley, and nook of Forli.
These Italian towns presented an appearance of still greater desolation, than those of England or France.
Plague had appeared here earlier--it had finished its course, and achieved its work much sooner than with us.
Probably the last summer had found no human being alive, in all the track included between the shores of Calabria and the northern Alps.
My search was utterly vain, yet I did not despond.
Reason methought was on my side; and the chances were by no means contemptible, that there should exist in some part of Italy a survivor like myself--of a wasted, depopulate land.
As therefore I rambled through the empty town, I formed my plan for future operations.
I would continue to journey on towards Rome.
After I should have satisfied myself, by a narrow search, that I left behind no human being in the towns through which I passed, I would write up in a conspicuous part of each, with white paint, in three languages, that "Verney, the last of the race of
In pursuance of this scheme, I entered a painter's shop, and procured myself the paint.
It is strange that so trivial an occupation should have consoled, and even enlivened me.
But grief renders one childish, despair fantastic.
To this simple inscription, I merely added the adjuration, "Friend, come!
I wait for thee!
--Deh, vieni!
ti aspetto"!
On the following morning, with something like hope for my companion, I quitted Forli on my way to Rome.
Until now, agonizing retrospect, and dreary prospects for the future, had stung me when awake, and cradled me to my repose.
Many times I had delivered myself up to the tyranny of anguish-- many times I resolved a speedy end to my woes; and death by my own hands was a remedy, whose practicability was even cheering to me.
What could I fear in the other world?
If there were an hell, and I were doomed to it, I should come an adept to the sufferance of its tortures--the act were easy, the speedy and certain end of my deplorable tragedy.
But now these thoughts faded before the new born expectation.
I went on my way, not as before, feeling each hour, each minute, to be an age instinct with incalculable pain.
As I wandered along the plain, at the foot of the Appennines--through their vallies, and over their bleak summits, my path led me through a country which had been trodden by heroes, visited and admired by thousands.
They had, as a tide, receded, leaving me blank and bare in the midst.
But why complain?
Did I not hope?
--so I schooled myself, even after the enlivening spirit had really deserted me, and thus I was obliged to call up all the fortitude I could command, and that was not much, to prevent a recurrence of that chaotic and intolerable despair, that had succeeded
I rose each day with the morning sun, and left my desolate inn.
As my feet strayed through the unpeopled country, my thoughts rambled through the universe, and I was least miserable when I could, absorbed in reverie, forget the passage of the hours.
Each evening, in spite of weariness, I detested to enter any dwelling, there to take up my nightly abode--I have sat, hour after hour, at the door of the cottage I had selected, unable to lift the latch, and meet face to face blank desertion within.
Many nights, though autumnal mists were spread around, I passed under an ilex--many times I have supped on arbutus berries and chestnuts, making a fire, gypsy-like, on the ground--because wild natural scenery reminded me less acutely of my hopeless state
I counted the days, and bore with me a peeled willow-wand, on which, as well as I could remember, I had notched the days that had elapsed since my wreck, and each night I added another unit to the melancholy sum.
I had toiled up a hill which led to Spoleto.
Around was spread a plain, encircled by the chestnut-covered Appennines.
A dark ravine was on one side, spanned by an aqueduct, whose tall arches were rooted in the dell below, and attested that man had once deigned to bestow labour and thought here, to adorn and civilize nature.
Savage, ungrateful nature, which in wild sport defaced his remains, protruding her easily renewed, and fragile growth of wild flowers and parasite plants around his eternal edifices.
I sat on a fragment of rock, and looked round.
The sun had bathed in gold the western atmosphere, and in the east the clouds caught the radiance, and budded into transient loveliness.
It set on a world that contained me alone for its inhabitant.
I took out my wand--I counted the marks.
Twenty-five were already traced--twenty-five days had already elapsed, since human voice had gladdened my ears, or human countenance met my gaze.
Twenty-five long, weary days, succeeded by dark and lonesome nights, had mingled with foregone years, and had become a part of the past--the never to be recalled--a real, undeniable portion of my life--twenty-five long, long days.
Why this was not a month!
--Why talk of days--or weeks--or months--I must grasp years in my imagination, if I would truly picture the future to myself--three, five, ten, twenty, fifty anniversaries of that fatal epoch might elapse--every year containing twelve months, each of more
Will it be?
--We had been used to look forward to death tremulously-- wherefore, but because its place was obscure?
But more terrible, and far more obscure, was the unveiled course of my lone futurity.
I broke my wand; I threw it from me.
I needed no recorder of the inch and barley-corn growth of my life, while my unquiet thoughts created other divisions, than those ruled over by the planets--and, in looking back on the age that had elapsed since I had been alone, I disdained to give the
I hid my face in my hands.
The twitter of the young birds going to rest, and their rustling among the trees, disturbed the still evening-air--the crickets chirped--the aziolo cooed at intervals.
My thoughts had been of death--these sounds spoke to me of life.
I lifted up my eyes--a bat wheeled round--the sun had sunk behind the jagged line of mountains, and the paly, crescent moon was visible, silver white, amidst the orange sunset, and accompanied by one bright star, prolonged thus the twilight.
A herd of cattle passed along in the dell below, untended, towards their watering place--the grass was rustled by a gentle breeze, and the olive-woods, mellowed into soft masses by the moonlight, contrasted their sea-green with the dark chestnut foliage.
Yes, this is the earth; there is no change--no ruin--no rent made in her verdurous expanse; she continues to wheel round and round, with alternate night and day, through the sky, though man is not her adorner or inhabitant.
Why could I not forget myself like one of those animals, and no longer suffer the wild tumult of misery that I endure?
Yet, ah!
what a deadly breach yawns between their state and mine!
Have not they companions?
Have not they each their mate--their cherished young, their home, which, though unexpressed to us, is, I doubt not, endeared and enriched, even in their eyes, by the society which kind nature has created for them?
It is I only that am alone--I, on this little hill top, gazing on plain and mountain recess--on sky, and its starry population, listening to every sound of earth, and air, and murmuring wave,--I only cannot express to any companion my many thoughts, nor
Shall I not then complain?
Shall I not curse the murderous engine which has mowed down the children of men, my brethren?
Shall I not bestow a malediction on every other of nature's offspring, which dares live and enjoy, while I live and suffer?
Ah, no!
I will discipline my sorrowing heart to sympathy in your joys; I will be happy, because ye are so.
Live on, ye innocents, nature's selected darlings; I am not much unlike to you.
Nerves, pulse, brain, joint, and flesh, of such am I composed, and ye are organized by the same laws.
I have something beyond this, but I will call it a defect, not an endowment, if it leads me to misery, while ye are happy.
Just then, there emerged from a near copse two goats and a little kid, by the mother's side; they began to browze the herbage of the hill.
I approached near to them, without their perceiving me; I gathered a handful of fresh grass, and held it out; the little one nestled close to its mother, while she timidly withdrew.
The male stepped forward, fixing his eyes on me: I drew near, still holding out my lure, while he, depressing his head, rushed at me with his horns.
I was a very fool; I knew it, yet I yielded to my rage.
I snatched up a huge fragment of rock; it would have crushed my rash foe.
I poized it--aimed it--then my heart failed me.
I hurled it wide of the mark; it rolled clattering among the bushes into dell.
My little visitants, all aghast, galloped back into the covert of the wood; while I, my very heart bleeding and torn, rushed down the hill, and by the violence of bodily exertion, sought to escape from my miserable self.
No, no, I will not live among the wild scenes of nature, the enemy of all that lives.
I will seek the towns--Rome, the capital of the world, the crown of man's achievements.
Among its storied streets, hallowed ruins, and stupendous remains of human exertion, I shall not, as here, find every thing forgetful of man; trampling on his memory, defacing his works, proclaiming from hill to hill, and vale to vale,--by the torrents
I hailed the Tiber, for that was as it were an unalienable possession of humanity.
I hailed the wild Campagna, for every rood had been trod by man; and its savage uncultivation, of no recent date, only proclaimed more distinctly his power, since he had given an honourable name and sacred title to what else would have been a worthless,
I entered Eternal Rome by the Porta del Popolo, and saluted with awe its time-honoured space.
The wide square, the churches near, the long extent of the Corso, the near eminence of Trinita de' Monti appeared like fairy work, they were so silent, so peaceful, and so very fair.
It was evening; and the population of animals which still existed in this mighty city, had gone to rest; there was no sound, save the murmur of its many fountains, whose soft monotony was harmony to my soul.
The knowledge that I was in Rome, soothed me; that wondrous city, hardly more illustrious for its heroes and sages, than for the power it exercised over the imaginations of men.
I went to rest that night; the eternal burning of my heart quenched,--my senses tranquil.
The next morning I eagerly began my rambles in search of oblivion.
I ascended the many terraces of the garden of the Colonna Palace, under whose roof I had been sleeping; and passing out from it at its summit, I found myself on Monte Cavallo.
The fountain sparkled in the sun; the obelisk above pierced the clear dark-blue air.
The statues on each side, the works, as they are inscribed, of Phidias and Praxiteles, stood in undiminished grandeur, representing Castor and Pollux, who with majestic power tamed the rearing animal at their side.
If those illustrious artists had in truth chiselled these forms, how many passing generations had their giant proportions outlived!
and now they were viewed by the last of the species they were sculptured to represent and deify.
I had shrunk into insignificance in my own eyes, as I considered the multitudinous beings these stone demigods had outlived, but this after-thought restored me to dignity in my own conception.
The sight of the poetry eternized in these statues, took the sting from the thought, arraying it only in poetic ideality.
I repeated to myself,--I am in Rome!
I behold, and as it were, familiarly converse with the wonder of the world, sovereign mistress of the imagination, majestic and eternal survivor of millions of generations of extinct men.
I endeavoured to quiet the sorrows of my aching heart, by even now taking an interest in what in my youth I had ardently longed to see.
Every part of Rome is replete with relics of ancient times.
The meanest streets are strewed with truncated columns, broken capitals--Corinthian and Ionic, and sparkling fragments of granite or porphyry.
The walls of the most penurious dwellings enclose a fluted pillar or ponderous stone, which once made part of the palace of the Caesars; and the voice of dead time, in still vibrations, is breathed from these dumb things, animated and glorified as they
I embraced the vast columns of the temple of Jupiter Stator, which survives in the open space that was the Forum, and leaning my burning cheek against its cold durability, I tried to lose the sense of present misery and present desertion, by recalling to
I rejoiced at my success, as I figured Camillus, the Gracchi, Cato, and last the heroes of Tacitus, which shine meteors of surpassing brightness during the murky night of the empire;--as the verses of Horace and Virgil, or the glowing periods of Cicero
I was delighted to know that I beheld the scene which they beheld--the scene which their wives and mothers, and crowds of the unnamed witnessed, while at the same time they honoured, applauded, or wept for these matchless specimens of humanity.
At length, then, I had found a consolation.
I had not vainly sought the storied precincts of Rome--I had discovered a medicine for my many and vital wounds.
I sat at the foot of these vast columns.
The Coliseum, whose naked ruin is robed by nature in a verdurous and glowing veil, lay in the sunlight on my right.
Not far off, to the left, was the Tower of the Capitol.
Triumphal arches, the falling walls of many temples, strewed the ground at my feet.
I strove, I resolved, to force myself to see the Plebeian multitude and lofty Patrician forms congregated around; and, as the Diorama of ages passed across my subdued fancy, they were replaced by the modern Roman; the Pope, in his white stole, distributing
The romance with which, dipping our pencils in the rainbow hues of sky and transcendent nature, we to a degree gratuitously endow the Italians, replaced the solemn grandeur of antiquity.
I remembered the dark monk, and floating figures of "The Italian," and how my boyish blood had thrilled at the description.
I called to mind Corinna ascending the Capitol to be crowned, and, passing from the heroine to the author, reflected how the Enchantress Spirit of Rome held sovereign sway over the minds of the imaginative, until it rested on me--sole remaining spectator
I was long wrapt by such ideas; but the soul wearies of a pauseless flight; and, stooping from its wheeling circuits round and round this spot, suddenly it fell ten thousand fathom deep, into the abyss of the present-- into self-knowledge--into tenfold
I roused myself--I cast off my waking dreams; and I, who just now could almost hear the shouts of the Roman throng, and was hustled by countless multitudes, now beheld the desart ruins of Rome sleeping under its own blue sky; the shadows lay tranquilly on
I was alone in the Forum; alone in Rome; alone in the world.
Would not one living man --one companion in my weary solitude, be worth all the glory and remembered power of this time-honoured city?
Double sorrow--sadness, bred in Cimmerian caves, robed my soul in a mourning garb.
The generations I had conjured up to my fancy, contrasted more strongly with the end of all --the single point in which, as a pyramid, the mighty fabric of society had ended, while I, on the giddy height, saw vacant space around me.
From such vague laments I turned to the contemplation of the minutiae of my situation.
So far, I had not succeeded in the sole object of my desires, the finding a companion for my desolation.
Yet I did not despair.
It is true that my inscriptions were set up for the most part, in insignificant towns and villages; yet, even without these memorials, it was possible that the person, who like me should find himself alone in a depopulate land, should, like me, come to
The more slender my expectation was, the more I chose to build on it, and to accommodate my actions to this vague possibility.
It became necessary therefore, that for a time I should domesticate myself at Rome.
It became necessary, that I should look my disaster in the face-- not playing the school-boy's part of obedience without submission; enduring life, and yet rebelling against the laws by which I lived.
Yet how could I resign myself?
Without love, without sympathy, without communion with any, how could I meet the morning sun, and with it trace its oft repeated journey to the evening shades?
Why did I continue to live-- why not throw off the weary weight of time, and with my own hand, let out the fluttering prisoner from my agonized breast?
--It was not cowardice that withheld me; for the true fortitude was to endure; and death had a soothing sound accompanying it, that would easily entice me to enter its demesne.
But this I would not do.
I had, from the moment I had reasoned on the subject, instituted myself the subject to fate, and the servant of necessity, the visible laws of the invisible God--I believed that my obedience was the result of sound reasoning, pure feeling, and an exalted
Could I have seen in this empty earth, in the seasons and their change, the hand of a blind power only, most willingly would I have placed my head on the sod, and closed my eyes on its loveliness for ever.
But fate had administered life to me, when the plague had already seized on its prey--she had dragged me by the hair from out the strangling waves--By such miracles she had bought me for her own; I admitted her authority, and bowed to her decrees.
If, after mature consideration, such was my resolve, it was doubly necessary that I should not lose the end of life, the improvement of my faculties, and poison its flow by repinings without end.
Yet how cease to repine, since there was no hand near to extract the barbed spear that had entered my heart of hearts?
I stretched out my hand, and it touched none whose sensations were responsive to mine.
I was girded, walled in, vaulted over, by seven-fold barriers of loneliness.
Occupation alone, if I could deliver myself up to it, would be capable of affording an opiate to my sleepless sense of woe.
Having determined to make Rome my abode, at least for some months, I made arrangements for my accommodation--I selected my home.
The Colonna Palace was well adapted for my purpose.
Its grandeur-- its treasure of paintings, its magnificent halls were objects soothing and even exhilarating.
I found the granaries of Rome well stored with grain, and particularly with Indian corn; this product requiring less art in its preparation for food, I selected as my principal support.
I now found the hardships and lawlessness of my youth turn to account.
A man cannot throw off the habits of sixteen years.
Since that age, it is true, I had lived luxuriously, or at least surrounded by all the conveniences civilization afforded.
But before that time, I had been "as uncouth a savage, as the wolf-bred founder of old Rome"--and now, in Rome itself, robber and shepherd propensities, similar to those of its founder, were of advantage to its sole inhabitant.
I spent the morning riding and shooting in the Campagna--I passed long hours in the various galleries--I gazed at each statue, and lost myself in a reverie before many a fair Madonna or beauteous nymph.
I haunted the Vatican, and stood surrounded by marble forms of divine beauty.
Each stone deity was possessed by sacred gladness, and the eternal fruition of love.
They looked on me with unsympathizing complacency, and often in wild accents I reproached them for their supreme indifference--for they were human shapes, the human form divine was manifest in each fairest limb and lineament.
The perfect moulding brought with it the idea of colour and motion; often, half in bitter mockery, half in self-delusion, I clasped their icy proportions, and, coming between Cupid and his Psyche's lips, pressed the unconceiving marble.
I endeavoured to read.
I visited the libraries of Rome.
I selected a volume, and, choosing some sequestered, shady nook, on the banks of the Tiber, or opposite the fair temple in the Borghese Gardens, or under the old pyramid of Cestius, I endeavoured to conceal me from myself, and immerse myself in the subject
As if in the same soil you plant nightshade and a myrtle tree, they will each appropriate the mould, moisture, and air administered, for the fostering their several properties--so did my grief find sustenance, and power of existence, and growth, in what
Ah!
while I streak this paper with the tale of what my so named occupations were--while I shape the skeleton of my days--my hand trembles--my heart pants, and my brain refuses to lend expression, or phrase, or idea, by which to image forth the veil of
O, worn and beating heart, may I dissect thy fibres, and tell how in each unmitigable misery, sadness dire, repinings, and despair, existed?
May I record my many ravings--the wild curses I hurled at torturing nature--and how I have passed days shut out from light and food--from all except the burning hell alive in my own bosom?
I was presented, meantime, with one other occupation, the one best fitted to discipline my melancholy thoughts, which strayed backwards, over many a ruin, and through many a flowery glade, even to the mountain recess, from which in early youth I had first
During one of my rambles through the habitations of Rome, I found writing materials on a table in an author's study.
Parts of a manuscript lay scattered about.
It contained a learned disquisition on the Italian language; one page an unfinished dedication to posterity, for whose profit the writer had sifted and selected the niceties of this harmonious language --to whose everlasting benefit he bequeathed his
I also will write a book, I cried--for whom to read?
--to whom dedicated?
And then with silly flourish (what so capricious and childish as despair?
) I wrote, DEDICATION TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS DEAD.
SHADOWS, ARISE, AND READ YOUR FALL!
BEHOLD THE HISTORY OF THE LAST MAN.
Yet, will not this world be re-peopled, and the children of a saved pair of lovers, in some to me unknown and unattainable seclusion, wandering to these prodigious relics of the ante-pestilential race, seek to learn how beings so wondrous in their
I will write and leave in this most ancient city, this "world's sole monument," a record of these things.
I will leave a monument of the existence of Verney, the Last Man.
At first I thought only to speak of plague, of death, and last, of desertion; but I lingered fondly on my early years, and recorded with sacred zeal the virtues of my companions.
They have been with me during the fulfilment of my task.
I have brought it to an end--I lift my eyes from my paper--again they are lost to me.
Again I feel that I am alone.
A year has passed since I have been thus occupied.
The seasons have made their wonted round, and decked this eternal city in a changeful robe of surpassing beauty.
A year has passed; and I no longer guess at my state or my prospects--loneliness is my familiar, sorrow my inseparable companion.
I have endeavoured to brave the storm--I have endeavoured to school myself to fortitude--I have sought to imbue myself with the lessons of wisdom.
It will not do.
My hair has become nearly grey--my voice, unused now to utter sound, comes strangely on my ears.
My person, with its human powers and features, seem to me a monstrous excrescence of nature.
How express in human language a woe human being until this hour never knew!
How give intelligible expression to a pang none but I could ever understand!
-- No one has entered Rome.
None will ever come.
I smile bitterly at the delusion I have so long nourished, and still more, when I reflect that I have exchanged it for another as delusive, as false, but to which I now cling with the same fond trust.
Winter has come again; and the gardens of Rome have lost their leaves-- the sharp air comes over the Campagna, and has driven its brute inhabitants to take up their abode in the many dwellings of the deserted city--frost has suspended the gushing
I had made a rough calculation, aided by the stars, by which I endeavoured to ascertain the first day of the new year.
In the old out-worn age, the Sovereign Pontiff was used to go in solemn pomp, and mark the renewal of the year by driving a nail in the gate of the temple of Janus.
On that day I ascended St. Peter's, and carved on its topmost stone the aera 2100, last year of the world!
My only companion was a dog, a shaggy fellow, half water and half shepherd's dog, whom I found tending sheep in the Campagna.
His master was dead, but nevertheless he continued fulfilling his duties in expectation of his return.
If a sheep strayed from the rest, he forced it to return to the flock, and sedulously kept off every intruder.
Riding in the Campagna I had come upon his sheep-walk, and for some time observed his repetition of lessons learned from man, now useless, though unforgotten.
His delight was excessive when he saw me.
He sprung up to my knees; he capered round and round, wagging his tail, with the short, quick bark of pleasure: he left his fold to follow me, and from that day has never neglected to watch by and attend on me, shewing boisterous gratitude whenever I
His pattering steps and mine alone were heard, when we entered the magnificent extent of nave and aisle of St. Peter's.
We ascended the myriad steps together, when on the summit I achieved my design, and in rough figures noted the date of the last year.
I then turned to gaze on the country, and to take leave of Rome.
I had long determined to quit it, and I now formed the plan I would adopt for my future career, after I had left this magnificent abode.
A solitary being is by instinct a wanderer, and that I would become.
A hope of amelioration always attends on change of place, which would even lighten the burthen of my life.
I had been a fool to remain in Rome all this time: Rome noted for Malaria, the famous caterer for death.
But it was still possible, that, could I visit the whole extent of earth, I should find in some part of the wide extent a survivor.
Methought the sea-side was the most probable retreat to be chosen by such a one.
If left alone in an inland district, still they could not continue in the spot where their last hopes had been extinguished; they would journey on, like me, in search of a partner for their solitude, till the watery barrier stopped their further progress.
To that water--cause of my woes, perhaps now to be their cure, I would betake myself.
Farewell, Italy!
--farewell, thou ornament of the world, matchless Rome, the retreat of the solitary one during long months!
--to civilized life--to the settled home and succession of monotonous days, farewell!
Peril will now be mine; and I hail her as a friend--death will perpetually cross my path, and I will meet him as a benefactor; hardship, inclement weather, and dangerous tempests will be my sworn mates.
Ye spirits of storm, receive me!
ye powers of destruction, open wide your arms, and clasp me for ever!
if a kinder power have not decreed another end, so that after long endurance I may reap my reward, and again feel my heart beat near the heart of another like to me.
Tiber, the road which is spread by nature's own hand, threading her continent, was at my feet, and many a boat was tethered to the banks.
I would with a few books, provisions, and my dog, embark in one of these and float down the current of the stream into the sea; and then, keeping near land, I would coast the beauteous shores and sunny promontories of the blue Mediterranean, pass Naples,
) skim ocean's surface towards Malta and the further Cyclades.
I would avoid Constantinople, the sight of whose well-known towers and inlets belonged to another state of existence from my present one; I would coast Asia Minor, and Syria, and, passing the seven-mouthed Nile, steer northward again, till losing sight of
And then--no matter where--the oozy caves, and soundless depths of ocean may be my dwelling, before I accomplish this long-drawn voyage, or the arrow of disease find my heart as I float singly on the weltering Mediterranean; or, in some place I touch at, I
These are wild dreams.
Yet since, now a week ago, they came on me, as I stood on the height of St. Peter's, they have ruled my imagination.
I have chosen my boat, and laid in my scant stores.
I have selected a few books; the principal are Homer and Shakespeare--But the libraries of the world are thrown open to me--and in any port I can renew my stock.
I form no expectation of alteration for the better; but the monotonous present is intolerable to me.
Neither hope nor joy are my pilots--restless despair and fierce desire of change lead me on.
I long to grapple with danger, to be excited by fear, to have some task, however slight or voluntary, for each day's fulfilment.
I shall witness all the variety of appearance, that the elements can assume--I shall read fair augury in the rainbow-- menace in the cloud--some lesson or record dear to my heart in everything.
Thus around the shores of deserted earth, while the sun is high, and the moon waxes or wanes, angels, the spirits of the dead, and the ever-open eye of the Supreme, will behold the tiny bark, freighted with Verney--the LAST MAN.
THE END.
