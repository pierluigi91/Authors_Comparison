THE PREFACE.
H_AVING taken more than ordinary Pains in collecting the Materials which compose the following History, we could not be satisfied with our selves, if any Thing were wanting to it, which might render it entirely satisfactory to the Publick: It is for this
_ _It is possible this Book may fall into the Hands of some Masters of Ships, and other honest Mariners, who frequently, by contrary Winds or Tempests, or other Accidents incident to long Voyages, find themselves reduced to great Distresses, either through
I say, it may be a Direction to such as those, what Lengths they may venture to go, without violating the Law of Nations, in Case they should meet other Ships at Sea, or be cast on some inhospitable Shore, which should refuse to trade with them for such
_ _We have given a few Instances in the Course of this History of the Inducements Men have to engage themselves headlong in a Life of so much Peril to themselves, and so destructive to the Navigation of the trading World; to remedy which Evil there seems
_ _I cannot but take Notice in this Place, that during this long Peace, I have not so much as heard of a _Dutch_ Pyrate: It is not that I take them to be honester than their Neighbours; but when we account for it, it will, perhaps, be a Reproach to our
Had ours the same Recourse in their Necessities, I'm certain we should find the same Effect from it; for a Fishery is a Trade that cannot be overstock'd; the Sea is wide enough for us all, we need not quarrel for Elbow-room: Its Stores are infinite, and
Besides, our own Coast, for the most Part, supply the _Dutch_, who employ several hundred Sail constantly in the Trade, and so sell to us our own Fish.
I call it our own, for the Sovereignty of the _British Seas_, are to this Day acknowledged us by the _Dutch_, and all the neighbouring Nations; wherefore, if there was a publick Spirit among us, it would be well worth our while to establish a National
_ _I need not bring any Proofs of what I advance, _viz.
_ that there are Multitudes of Seamen at this Day unemploy'd; it is but too evident by their straggling, and begging all over the Kingdom.
Nor is it so much their Inclination to Idleness, as their own hard Fate, in being cast off after their Work is done, to starve or steal.
I have not known a Man of War commission'd for several Years past, but three times her Compliment of Men have offer'd themselves in _24_ Hours; the Merchants take their Advantage of this, lessen their Wages, and those few who are in Business are poorly
_ _I shall not repeat what I have said in the History concerning the Privateers of the _West-Indies_, where I have taken Notice they live upon Spoil; and as Custom is a second Nature, it is no Wonder that, when an honest Livlyhood is not easily had, they
_ _Now we have accounted for their Rise and Beginning, it will be natural to enquire why they are not taken and destroy'd, before they come to any Head, seeing that they are seldom less than twelve Men of War stationed in our American Plantations, even in
This Enquiry, perhaps, will not turn much to the Honour of those concern'd in that Service; however, I hope I may be excus'd, if what I hint is with a Design of serving the Publick.
_ _I say, 'tis strange that a few Pyrates should ravage the Seas for Years, without ever being light upon, by any of our Ships of War; when in the mean Time, they (the Pyrates) shall take Fleets of Ships; it looks as if one was much more diligent in their
_Roberts_ and his Crew, alone, took 400 Sail, before he was destroy'd.
_ _This Matter, I may probably set right another Time, and only observe for the present, that the Pyrates at Sea, have the same Sagacity with Robbers at Land; as the latter understand what Roads are most frequented, and where it is most likely to meet with
_ _To make this a little plainer to my Country Readers, I must observe that all our outward bound Ships, sometime after they leave the Land, steer into the Latitude of the Place they are bound to; if to the _West-India_ Islands, or any Part of the Main of
_ because the Latitude is the only Certainty in those Voyages to be found, and then they sail due West, till they come to their Port, without altering their Course.
In this West Way lie the Pyrates, whether it be to _Virginia_, _&c.
_ or _Nevis_, _St. Christophers_, _Montserat_, _Jamaica_, _&c.
_ so that if the Merchant Ships bound thither, do not fall a Prey to them one Day, they must another: Therefore I say, if the Men of War take the same Track, the Pyrates must unavoidably fall into their Mouths, or be frighted away, for where the Game is,
_ _I must observe another Thing, that the Pyrates generally shift their Rovings, according to the Season of the Year; in the Summer they cruise mostly along the Coast of the Continent of _America_, but the Winters there, being a little too cold for them,
Every Man who has used the _West-India_ Trade, knows this to be true; therefore, since we are so well acquainted with all their Motions, I cannot see why our Men of War under a proper Regulation, may not go to the Southward, instead of lying up all the
_ _It will be observed, that the Account of the Actions of _Roberts_ runs into a greater Length, than that of any other Pyrate, for which we can assign two Reasons, first, because he ravaged the Seas longer than the rest, and of Consequence there must be a
_ _As to the Lives of our two female Pyrates, we must confess they may appear a little Extravagant, yet they are never the less true for seeming so, but as they were publickly try'd for their Pyracies, there are living Witnesses enough to justify what we
_ _I presume we need make no Apology for giving the Name of a History to the following Sheets, though they contain nothing but the Actions of a Parcel of Robbers.
It is Bravery and Stratagem in War which make Actions worthy of Record; in which Sense the Adventures, here related will be thought deserving that Name.
_Plutarch_ is very circumstantial in relating the Actions of _Spartacus_, the Slave, and makes the Conquest of him, one of the greatest Glories of _Marcus Crassus_; and it is probable, if this Slave had liv'd a little longer, _Plutarch_ would have given us
_Rome_, the Misstress of the World, was no more at first than a Refuge for Thieves and Outlaws; and if the Progress of our Pyrates had been equal to their Beginning; had they all united, and settled in some of those Islands, they might, by this Time, have
_ _If we have seem'd to glance, with some Freedom, at the Behaviour of some Governors of Provinces abroad, it has been with Caution; and, perhaps, we have, not declar'd as much as we knew: However, we hope those Gentlemen in the same Station, who have
_ P. S. _It will be necessary to add a Word or two to this Preface, in order to inform the Reader, that there are several material Additions made to this second Impression, which swelling the Book in Bulk, must of Consequence add a small Matter to its
_ _The first Impression having been received with so much Success by the Publick, occasioned a very earnest Demand for a second: In the mean Time, several Persons who had been taken by the Pyrates, as well as others who had been concerned in taking of
This occasioned some Delay, therefore if we have not brought it out, as soon as wish'd, it was to render it the more compleat.
_ _We shall not enter into a Detail of all the new Matter inserted here, but the Description of the Islands _St. Thome_, _&c.
_ and that of _Brasil_ are not to be passed by, without a little Notice.
It must be observed, that our speculative Mathematicians and Geographers, who are, no doubt, Men of the greatest Learning, seldom travel farther than their Closets for their Knowledge, _&c.
_ are therefore unqualified to give us a good Description of Countries: It is for this Reason that all our Maps and Atlasses are so monstrously faulty, for these Gentlemen are obliged to take their Accounts from the Reports of illiterate Men.
_ _It must be noted also, that when the Masters of Ships make Discoveries this Way, they are not fond of communicating them; a Man's knowing this or that Coast, better than others, recommends him in his Business, and makes him more useful, and he'll no
_ _The Gentleman who has taken the Pains to make these Observations, is _Mr. Atkins_, a Surgeon, an ingenious Man in his own Profession, and one who is not ty'd down by any narrow Considerations from doing a Service to the Publick, and has been pleased
I don't doubt, but his Observations will be found curious and very serviceable to such as Trade to those Parts, besides a Method of Trade is here laid down with the _Portuguese_, which may prove of great Profit to some of our Countrymen, if followed
_ _It is hoped these Things will satisfy the Publick, that the Author of the following Sheets considered nothing so much as making the Book useful;--tho' he has been informed, that some Gentlemen have rais'd an Objection against the Truth of its Contents,
_ that it seems calculated to entertain and divert.
--If the Facts are related with some Agreeableness and Life, we hope it will not be imputed as a Fault; but as to its Credit, we can assure them that the Sea-faring Men, that is all that know the Nature of these Things, have not been able to make the least
_ _There have been some other Pyrates, besides those whose History are here related, such as are hereafter named, and their Adventures are as extravagant and full of Mischief, as those who are the Subject of this Book.
--The Author has already begun to digest them into Method, and as soon, as he receives some Materials to make them compleat, (which he shortly expects from the _West-Indies_).
If the Publick gives him Encouragement he intends to venture upon a second Volume.

THE HISTORY OF THE PYRATES.
INTRODUCTION.
AS the Pyrates in the _West-Indies_ have been so formidable and numerous, that they have interrupted the Trade of _Europe_ into those Parts; and our _English_ Merchants, in particular, have suffered more by their Depredations, than by the united Force of
But before we enter upon their particular History, it will not be amiss, by way of Introduction, to shew, by some Examples drawn from History, the great Mischief and Danger which threaten Kingdoms and Commonwealths, from the Increase of these sort of
It has been the Case heretofore, that when a single Pyrate has been suffered to range the Seas, as not being worth the Notice of a Government, he has by Degrees grown so powerful, as to put them to the Expence of a great deal of Blood and Treasure, before
We shall not examine how it came to pass, that our Pyrates in the _West-Indies_ have continually increased till of late; this is an Enquiry which belongs to the Legislature, or Representatives of the People in Parliament, and to them we shall leave it.
Our Business shall be briefly to shew, what from Beginnings, as inconsiderable as these, other Nations have suffered.
In the Times of _Marius_ and _Sylla_, _Rome_ was in her greatest Strength, yet she was so torn in Pieces by the Factions of those two great Men, that every Thing which concerned the publick Good was altogether neglected, when certain Pyrates broke out from
This Beginning was mean and inconsiderable, having but two or three Ships, and a few Men, with which they cruised about the _Greek_ Islands, taking such Ships as were very ill arm'd or weakly defended; however, by the taking of many Prizes, they soon
He pass'd eight and thirty Days, and seemed so little concerned or afraid, that often when he went to sleep, he used to charge them not to make a Noise, threatening, if they disturbed him, to hang them all; he also play'd at Dice with them, and sometimes
They took all these as the Sallies of a juvenile Humour, and were rather diverted, than displeased at them.
At length his Attendants return'd with his Ransom, which he paid, and was discharged; he sail'd for the Port of _Miletum_, where, as soon as he was arriv'd, he used all his Art and Industry in fitting out a Squadron of Ships, which he equipp'd and arm'd at
_Cæsar_ went strait to Rome, where, being engaged in the Designs of his own private Ambition, as were almost all the leading Men in Rome, the Pyrates who were left, had Time to increase to a prodigious Strength; for while the civil Wars lasted, the Seas
Nor were they content with committing Pyracies and Insolencies by Sea, they committed as great Depredations by Land, or rather made Conquests; for they took and sack'd no less than four hundred Cities, laid several others under Contributions, plundered the
A Body of them once took _Sextillius_ and _Bellinus_, two _Roman_ Prætors, in their purple Robes, going from Rome to their Governments, and carried them away with all their Sergeants, Officers and Vergers; they also took the Daughter of _Antonius_ a
But what was most barbarous, was a Custom they had when they took any Ship, of enquiring of the Person on Board, concerning their Names and Country; if any of them said he was a _Roman_, they fell down upon their Knees, as if in a Fright at the Greatness
Thus, while _Rome_ was Mistress oft he World, she suffered Insults and Affronts, almost at her Gates, from these powerful Robbers; but what for a while made Faction cease, and roused the Genius of that People, never used to suffer Wrongs from a fair Enemy,
_Pompey_ finding the _Mediterranean_ quite clear, appointed a Meeting of all his Fleet at the Haven of _Brundusium_, and from thence sailing round into the _Adriatick_, he went directly to attack these Pyrates in their Hives; as soon as he came near the
But it is probable, that had these Pyrates receiv'd sufficient Notice of the _Roman_ Preparation against them, so as they might have had Time to draw their scattered Strength into a Body, to have met _Pompey_ by Sea, the Advantage appeared greatly on their
This is a Proof how dangerous it is to Governments to be negligent, and not take an early Care in suppressing these Sea Banditti, before they gather Strength.
The Truth of this Maxim may be better exemplified in the History of _Barbarouse_, a Native in the City of _Mitylene_, in the Island of _Lesbos_, in the _Egean_ Sea; a Fellow of ordinary Birth, who being bred to the Sea, first set out from thence upon the
About this Time it happened that _Selim Eutemi_, King of _Algiers_, having refused to pay the accustomed Tribute to the _Spaniards_, was apprehensive of an Invasion from thence; wherefore he treated with _Barbarouse_, upon the Foot of an Ally, to come and
* * * I come now to speak of the Pyrates infesting the _West-Indies_, where they are more numerous than in any other Parts of the World, on several Reasons: _First_, Because there are so many uninhabited little Islands and Keys, with Harbours convenient
It may here perhaps be no unnecessary Digression, to explain upon what they call Keys in the _West-Indies_: These are small sandy Islands, appearing a little above the Surf of the Water, with only a few Bushes or Weeds upon them, but abound (those most at
I am apt to think these _Keys_, especially those nigh Islands, to have been once contiguous with them, and separated by Earthquakes (frequently there) or Inundations, because some of them that have been within continual View, as those nigh _Jamaica_, are
There are not only of the Use above taken Notice of to Pyrates; but it is commonly believed were always in buccaneering pyratical Times, the hiding Places for their Riches, and often Times a Shelter for themselves, till their Friends on the Main, had found
Secondly, another Reason why these Seas are chose by Pyrates, is the great Commerce thither by _French_, _Spaniards_, _Dutch_, and especially _English_ Ships: They are sure in the Latitude of these trading Islands, to meet with Prizes, Booties of
A third Reason, is the Inconveniency and Difficulty of being pursued by the Men of War, the many small Inlets, Lagoons and Harbours, on these solitary Islands and Keys, is a natural Security.
'Tis generally here that the Pyrates begin their Enterprizes, setting out at first with a very small Force; and by infesting these Seas, and those of the Continent of _North-America_, in a Year's Time, if they have good luck on their Sides, they accumulate
But that I may not give too much Encouragement to the Profession, I must inform my maritime Readers, that the far greater Part of these Rovers are cut short in the Pursuit, by a sudden Precipitation into the other World.
The Rise of these Rovers, since the Peace of _Utrecht_, or at least, the great Encrease of them, may justly be computed to the _Spanish_ Settlements in the _West Indies_; the Governors of which, being often some hungry Courtiers, sent thither to repair or
But if the _Spanish_ Captains chance to exceed this Commission, and rob and plunder at Discretion, the Sufferers are allowed to complain, and exhibit a Process in their Court, and after great Expence of Suit, Delay of Time, and other Inconveniencies,
The frequent Losses sustain'd by our Merchants abroad, by these Pyrates, was Provocation enough to attempt something by way of Reprisal; and a fair Opportunity offering it self in the Year 1716, the Traders of the _West-Indies_, took Care not to slip it
It was about two Years before, that the _Spanish_ Galleons, or Plate Fleet, had been cast away in the Gulf or _Florida_; and several Vessels from the _Havana_, were at work, with diving Engines, to fish up the Silver that was on board the Galleons.
The _Spaniards_ had recovered some Millions of Pieces of Eight, and had carried it all to the _Havana_; but they had at present about 350000 Pieces of Eight in Silver, then upon the Spot, and were daily taking up more.
In the mean time, two Ships, and three Sloops, fitted out from _Jamaica_, _Barbadoes_, _&c.
_ under Captain _Henry Jennings_, sail'd to the Gulf, and found the _Spaniards_ there upon the Wreck; the Money before spoken of, was left on Shore, deposited in a Store-House, under the Government of two Commissaries, and a Guard of about 60 Soldiers.
The Rovers came directly upon the Place, bringing their little Fleet to an Anchor, and, in a Word, landing 300 Men, they attack'd the Guard, who immediately ran away; and thus they seized the Treasure, which they carried off, making the best of their Way
In their Way they unhappily met with a _Spanish_ Ship, bound from _Porto Bello_ to the _Havana_, with a great many rich Goods, _viz.
_ Bales of Cochineal, Casks of Indico, and 60000 Pieces of Eight more, which their Hands being in, they took, and having rifled the Vessel, let her go.
They went away to _Jamaica_ with their Booty, and were followed in View of the Port, by the _Spaniards_, who having seen them thither, went back to the Governor of the _Havana_, with the Account of it, who immediately sent a Vessel to the Governor of
As it was in full Peace, and contrary to all Justice and Right, that this Fact was committed, they were soon made sensible that the Government at _Jamaica_ would not suffer them to go unpunished, much less protect them.
Therefore they saw a Necessity of shifting for themselves; so, to make bad worse, they went to Sea again, tho' not without disposing of their Cargo to good Advantage, and furnishing themselves with Ammunition, Provisions, _&c.
_ and being thus made desperate, they turn'd Pyrates, robbing not the _Spaniards_ only, but their own Countrymen, and any Nation they could lay their Hands on.
It happened about this Time, that the _Spaniards_, with three or four small Men of War, fell upon our Logwood Cutters, in the Bay of _Campeachy_, and Bay or _Honduras_; and after they had made Prizes of the following Ships and Vessels, they gave the Men

The Rovers being now pretty strong, they consulted together about getting some Place of Retreat, where they might lodge their Wealth, clean and repair their Ships, and make themselves a kind of Abode.
They were not long in resolving, but fixed upon the Island of _Providence_, the most considerable of the _Bahama_ Islands, lying in the Latitude of about 24 Degrees North, and to the Eastward of the _Spanish Florida_.
This Island is about 28 Miles long, and eleven where broadest, and has a Harbour big enough to hold 500 Sail of Ships; before which lies a small Island, which makes two Inlets to the Harbour; at either Way there is a Bar, over which no Ship of 500 Tun can
The _Bahama_ Islands were possess'd by the _English_ till the Year 1700, when the _French_ and _Spaniards_ from _Petit Guavus_, invaded them, took the Fort and Governor in the Island of _Providence_, plunder'd and destroy'd the Settlements, _&c.
_ carried off half the Blacks, and the rest of the People, who fled to the Woods, retired afterwards to _Carolina_.
In March 1705-6, the House of Lords did in an Address to her late Majesty, set forth, `That the _French_ and _Spaniards_ had twice, during the Time of the War, over run and plundered the _Bahama_ Islands, that there was no Form of Government there: That
But, however it happened, no Means were used in compliance to that Address, for securing the _Bahama_ Islands, till the _English_ Pyrates had made _Providence_ their Retreat and general Receptacle; then 'twas found absolutely necessary, in order to

Besides these Frigots, two Men of War were ordered to attend Captain _Rogers_, late Commander of the two _Bristol_ Ships, called the _Duke_ and _Dutchess_, that took the rich _Acapulca_ Ship, and made a Tour round the Globe.
This Gentleman received a Commission from his Majesty, to be Governor of the Island of _Providence_, and was vested with Power to make Use of all possible Methods for reducing the Pyrates; and that nothing might be wanting, he carried with him, the King's

Before Governor _Rogers_ went over, the Proclamation was sent to them, which they took as _Teague_ took the Covenant, that is, they made Prize of the Ship and Proclamation too; however, they sent for those who were out a Cruising, and called a general
But Captain _Jennings_, who was their Commadore, and who always bore a great Sway among them, being a Man of good Understanding, and good Estate, before this Whim took him of going a Pyrating, resolved upon surrendering, without more ado, to the Terms of
The Commanders who were then in the Island, besides Captain _Jennings_ abovementioned, I think were these, _Benjamin Hornigold, Edward Teach, John Martel, James Fife, Christopher Winter, Nicholas Brown, Paul Williams, Charles Bellamy, Oliver la Bouche,

Cocklyn, R. Sample, Charles Vane_, and two or three others: _Hornigold, Williams, Burgess _and_ la Bouche_ were afterwards cast away; _Teach_ and _Penner_ killed, and their Crews taken; _James Fife_ killed by his own Men; _Martel_'s Crew destroyed, and he
In the Month of _May_ or _June_ 1718, Captain _Rogers_ arrived at his Government, with two of his Majesty's Ships, and found several of the abovesaid Pyrates there, who upon the coming of the Men of War, all surrendered to the Pardon, except _Charles Vane_
I have before described the Harbour to have two Inlets, by Means of a small Island lying at the Mouth of it; at one of which, both the Men of War entered, and left the other open, so that _Vane_ slip'd his Cable, set Fire to a large Prize they had there,
As soon as Captain _Rogers_ had settled himself in his Government, he built a Fort for his Defence, and garrisoned it with the People he found upon the Island; the _quondam_ Pyrates, to the Number of 400, he formed into Companies, appointed Officers of

_Yes_, answered one of them, _I do heartily repent; I repent I had not done more Mischief, and that we did not cut the Throats of them that took us, and I am extremely sorry that you an't all hang'd as well as we.

I. OF Captain _AVERY_, And his CREW.
NONE of these bold Adventurers were ever so much talked of, for a while, as _Avery_; he made as great a Noise in the World as _Meriveis_ does now, and was looked upon to be a Person of as great Consequence; he was represented in _Europe_, as one that had
A Play was writ upon him, called, the _Successful Pyrate_; and, these Accounts obtained such Belief, that several Schemes were offered to the Council for fitting out a Squadron to take him; while others were for offering him and his Companions an Act of
Yet all these were no more than false Rumours, improved by the Credulity of some, and the Humour of others who love to tell strange Things; for, while it was said, he was aspiring at a Crown, he wanted a Shilling; and at the same Time it was given out he
No doubt, but the Reader will have a Curiosity of knowing what became of this Man, and what were the true Grounds of so many false Reports concerning him; there fore, I shall, in as brief a Manner as I can, give his History.
He was born in the West of _England_ near _Plymouth_ in _Devonshire_, being bred to the Sea, he served as a Mate of a Merchant-Man, in several trading Voyages: It happened before the Peace of _Ryfwick_, when there was an Alliance betwixt _Spain_,
_ against _France_, that the _French_ in _Martinico_, carried on a smugling Trade with the _Spaniards_ on the Continent of _Peru_, which by the Laws of _Spain_, is not allowed to Friends in Time of Peace, for none but native _Spaniards_ are permitted to
Now the _French_ growing very bold in Trade, and the _Spaniards_ being poorly provided with Ships, and those they had being of no Force, it often fell out, that when they light of the _French_ Smuglers, they were not strong enough to attack them, therefore
Of one of these Ships, which I take to be call'd the _Duke_, Capt.
_Gibson_ Commander, _Avery_ was first Mate, and being a Fellow of more Cunning than Courage, he insinuated himself into the good Will of several of the boldest Fellows on Board the other Ship, as well as that which he was on Board of; having sounded their
It was no sooner said than agreed to, and they resolved to execute their Plot at Ten a Clock the Night following.
It must be observ'd, the Captain was one of those who are mightily addicted to Punch, so that he passed most of his Time on Shore, in some little drinking Ordinary; but this Day he did not go on Shore as usual; however, this did not spoil the Design, for
At the Time agreed on, the _Dutchess_'s Long-Boat appear'd, which _Avery_ hailing in the usual Manner, was answered by the Men in her, _Is your drunken Boatswain on Board?
_ Which was the Watch-Word agreed between them, and _Avery_ replying in the Affirmative, the Boat came aboard with sixteen stout Fellows, and joined the Company.
When our Gentry saw that all was clear, they secured the Hatches, so went to work; they did not slip the Anchor, but weigh'd it leisurely, and so put to Sea without any Disorder or Confusion, tho' there were several Ships then lying in the Bay, and among
The Captain, who by this Time, was awaked, either by the Motion of the Ship, or the Noise of working the Tackles, rung the Bell; _Avery_ and two others went into the Cabin; the Captain, half asleep, and in a kind of Fright, ask'd, _What was the Matter?
_ _Avery_ answered cooly, _Nothing_; the Captain replied, _something's the Matter with the Ship, Does she drive?
What Weather is it?
_ Thinking nothing less then that it had been a Storm, and that the Ship was driven from her Anchors: _No, no_, answered _Avery_, _we're at Sea, with a fair Wind and good Weather.
At Sea!
_says the Captain, _How can that be?
Come_, says _Avery, don't be in a Fright, but put on your Cloaths, and I'll let you into a Secret: -- You muse know, that I am Captain of this Ship now, and this is my Cabin, therefore you must walk out; I am bound to _Madagascar_, with a Design of making
_ The Captain having a little recovered his Senses, began to apprehend the meaning; however, his Fright was as great as before, which _Avery_ perceiving, bad him fear nothing, for, says he, if you have a Mind to make one of us, we will receive you, and if
The Captain was glad to hear this, and therefore accepted of his Offer, and the whole Crew being called up, to know who was willing to go on Shore with the Captain, and who to seek their Fortunes with the rest; there were not above five or six who were
They proceeded on their Voyage to _Madagascar_, but I do not find they took any Ships in their Way; when they arrived at the N. E. Part of that Island, they found two Sloops at Anchor, who, upon seeing them, slip'd their Cables and run themselves ashore,
He guessed where they were, and sent some of his Men on Shore to let them know they were Friends, and to offer they might join together for their common Safety; the Sloops Men were well arm'd, and had posted themselves in a Wood, with Centinels just on the
The Sloops Men were rejoiced at the new Ally, for their Vessels were so small, that they could not attack a Ship of any Force, so that hitherto they had not taken any considerable Prize, but now they hop'd to fly at high Game; and _Avery_ was as well
Having consulted what was to be done, they resolved to sail out together upon a Cruize, the Galley and two Sloops; they therefore fell to work to get the Sloops off, which they soon effected, and steered towards the _Arabian_ Coast; near the River _Indus_,
It is known that the Eastern People travel with the utmost Magnificence, so that they had with them all their Slaves and Attendants, their rich Habits and Jewels, with Vessels of Gold and Silver, and great Sums of Money to defray the Charges of their
Having taken all the Treasure on Board their own Ships, and plundered their Prize of every Thing else they either wanted or liked, they let her go; she not being able to continue her Voyage, returned back: As soon as the News came to the _Mogul_, and he
The _East-India_ Company in _England_, were very much alarmed at it; however, by Degrees, they found Means to pacify him, by promising to do their Endeavours to take the Robbers, and deliver them into his Hands; however, the great Noise this Thing made in
In the mean Time our successful Plunderers agreed to make the best of their Way back to _Madagascar_, intending to make that Place their Magazine or Repository for all their Treasure, and to build a small Fortification there, and leave a few Hands always
As they were Steering their Course, as has been said, he sends a Boat on Board of each of the Sloops, desiring the Chief of them to come on Board of him, in order to hold a Council; they did so, and he told them he had something to propose to them for the
Upon considering this Proposal, it appeared so seasonable to them, that they readily came into it, for they argued to themselves, that an Accident might happen to one of the Sloops and the other escape, wherefore it was for the common Good.
The Thing was done as agreed to, the Treasure put on Board of _Avery_, and the Chests seal'd; they kept Company that Day and the next, the Weather being fair, in which Time _Avery_ tampered with his Men, telling them they now had sufficient, to make them
In fine, they took Advantage of the Darkness that Night, steer'd another Course, and, by Morning, lost Sight of them.
I leave the Reader to judge, what Swearing and Confusion there was among the Sloop's Men, in the Morning, when they saw that _Avery_ had given them the Slip; for they knew by the Fairness of the Weather, and the Course they had agreed to steer, that it
_Avery_, and his Men, having consulted what to do with themselves, came to a Resolution, to make the best of their Way towards _America_; and none of them being known in those Parts, they intended to divide the Treasure, to change their Names, to go
The first Land they made, was the Island of _Providence_, then newly settled; here they staid some Time, and having considered that when they should go to _New-England_, the Greatness of their Ship, would cause much Enquiry about them; and possibly some
In this Sloop, he and his Companions embarq'd, they touch'd at several Parts of _America_, where no Person suspected them; and some of them went on Shore, and dispersed themselves about the Country, having received such Dividends as _Avery_ would give
At length he came to _Boston_, in _New-England_, and seem'd to have a Desire of settling in those Parts, and some of his Companions went on Shore there also, but he changed his Resolution, and proposed to the few of his Companions who were left, to sail
In their Voyage to Ireland, they avoided St. _George_'s Channel, and sailing North about, they put into one of the Northern Ports of that Kingdom; there they disposed of their Sloop, and coming on Shore they separated themselves, some going to _Cork_, and
When _Avery_ had remain'd some Time in this Kingdom, he was afraid to offer his Diamonds to sale, least an Enquiry into his Manner of coming by them should occasion a Discovery; therefore considering with himself what was best to be done, he fancied there
_Avery_ liked the Proposal, for he found no other Way of managing his Affairs, since he could not appear in them himself; therefore his Friend going back to _Bristol_, and opening the Matter to the Merchants, they made _Avery_ a Visit at _Biddiford_,
He changed his Name and lived at _Biddiford_, without making any Figure, and therefore there was no great Notice taken of him; yet let one or two of his Relations know where he was, who came to see him.
In some Time his little Money was spent, yet he heard nothing from his Merchants; he writ to them often, and after much Importunity they sent him a small Supply, but scarce sufficient to pay his Debts: In fine, the Supplies they sent him from Time to Time,
Whether he was frightened by these Menaces, or had seen some Body else he thought knew him, is not known; but he went immediately over to _Ireland_, and from thence sollicited his Merchants very hard for a Supply, but to no Purpose, for he was even reduced
He put himself on Board a trading Vessel, and work'd his Passage over to _Plymouth_, from whence he travelled on Foot to _Biddiford_, where he had been but a few Days before he fell sick and died; not being worth as much as would buy him a Coffin.
Thus have I given all that could be collected of any Certainty concerning this Man; rejecting the idle Stories which were made of his fantastick Greatness, by which it appears, that his Actions were more inconsiderable than those of other Pyrates, since
Now we shall turn back and give our Readers some Account of what became of the two Sloops.
We took Notice of the Rage and Confusion, which must have seized them, upon their missing of _Avery_; however, they continued their Course, some of them still flattering themselves that he had only out sailed them in the Night, and that they should find
It was Time to consider what they should do with themselves, their Stock of Sea Provision was almost spent, and tho' there was Rice and Fish, and Fowl to be had ashore, yet these would not keep for Sea, without being properly cured with Salt, which they
Here they met with several of their Countrymen, the Crew of a Privateer Sloop which was commanded by Captain _Thomas Tew_; and since it will be but a short Digression, we will give an Account how they came here.
Captain _George Dew_ and Captain _Thomas Tew_, having received Commissions from the then Governor of _Bermudas_, to sail directly for the River _Gambia_ in _Africa_; there, with the Advice and Assistance of the Agents of the Royal _African_ Company, to
In a few Days after they sailed out, _Dew_ in a violent Storm, not only sprung his Mast, but lost Sight of his Consort; _Dew_ therefore returned back to refit, and _Tew_ instead of proceeding on his Voyage, made for the _Cape of Good Hope_, and doubling
Here he came up with a large Ship, richly laden, bound from the _Indies_ to _Arabia_, with three hundred Soldiers on Board, besides Seamen; yet _Tew_ had the Hardiness to board her, and soon carried her; and, 'tis said, by this Prize, his Men shared near
--This differing in Opinion created some ill Blood amongst them, so that they resolved to break up pyrating, and no Place was so fit to receive them as _Madagascar_; hither they steered, resolving to live on Shore and enjoy what they got.
As for _Tew_ himself, he with a few others in a short Time went off to _Rhode Island_, from whence he made his Peace.
Thus have we accounted for the Company our Pyrates met with here.
It must be observed that the Natives of _Madagascar_ are a kind of Negroes, they differ from those of _Guiney_ in their Hair, which is long, and their Complexion is not so good a Jet; they have innumerable little Princes among them, who are continually
By these Means they not only became feared, but powerful; all the Prisoners of War, they took to be their Slaves; they married the most beautiful of the Negroe Women; not one or two, but as many as they liked; so that every one of them had as great a
_ besides which, they had abundance of others, who lived, as it were, under their Protection, and to be secure from the Disturbances or Attacks of their powerful Neighbours; these seemed to pay them a willing Homage.
Now they began to divide from one another, each living with his own Wives, Slaves and Dependants, like a separate Prince; and as Power and Plenty naturally beget Contention, they sometimes quarrelled with one another, and attacked each other at the Head of
It must be observed that these sudden great Men, had used their Power like Tyrants, for they grew wanton in Cruelty, and nothing was more common, than upon the slightest Displeasure, to cause one of their Dependants to be tied to a Tree and shot thro' the
This Escape made them very cautious from that Time, and it will be worth while to describe the Policy of these brutish Fellows, and to shew what Measures they took to secure themselves.
They found that the Fear of their Power could not secure them against a Surprize, and the bravest Man may be kill'd when he is asleep, by one much his inferior in Courage and Strength, therefore, as their first Security, they did all they could to foment
They strengthened their Party, and tied some to them by interest; when there was no War, they contrived to spirit up private Quarrels among them, and upon every little Dispute or Misunderstanding, push on one Side or other to Revenge; instruct them how to
Such as these were fast Friends, as their Lives depended upon the safety of his Protectors; for as we observed before, our Pyrates were grown so terrible, that none of their Neighbours had Resolution enough to attack them in an open War.
By such Arts as these, in the Space of a few Years, their Body was greatly increased, they then began to separate themselves, and remove at a greater Distance from one another, for the Convenience of more Ground, and were divided like Jews, into Tribes,
In this Plan of Fortification they imitated one another, their Dwellings were rather Citadels than Houses; they made Choice of a Place overgrown with Wood, and scituate near a Water; they raised a Rampart or high Ditch round it, so strait and high, that it
Thus Tyrant like they lived, fearing and feared by all; and in this Scituation they were found by Captain _Woods Rogers_, when he went to _Madagascar_, in the _Delicia_, a Ship of forty Guns, with a Design of buying Slaves in order to sell to the _Dutch_
Upon their first seeing a Ship of this Force and Burthen, they supposed it to be a Man of War sent to take them; they therefore lurked within their Fastnesses, but when some from the Ship came on Shore, without any shew of Hostility, and offering to trade
Having been so many Years upon this Island, it may be imagined, their Cloaths had long been worn out, so that their Majesties were extreamly out at the Elbows; I cannot say they were ragged, since they had no Cloaths, they had nothing to cover them but the
However, they soon got rigg'd, for they sold great Numbers of those poor People under them, for Cloaths, Knives, Saws, Powder and Ball, and many other Things, and became so familiar that they went aboard the _Delicia_, and were observed to be very curious,
Their Design in doing this, as they afterwards confessed, was to try if it was not practicable to surprize the Ship in the Night, which they judged very easy, in case there was but a slender Watch kept on Board, they having Boats and Men enough at Command,
Before he sailed away, and they found that nothing was to be done, they confessed all the Designs they had formed against him.
Thus he left them as he found them, in a great deal of dirty State and Royalty, but with fewer Subjects than they had, having, as we observed, sold many of them; and if Ambition be the darling Passion of Men, no doubt they were happy.
One of these great Princes had formerly been a Waterman upon the _Thames_, where having committed a Murder, he fled to the _West-Indies_, and was of the Number of those who run away with the Sloops; the rest had been all foremast Men, nor was there a Man
This is all the Account we can give of these Kings of _Madagascar_, some of whom it is probable are reigning to this Day.

They proceeded after this to the Port of _Cavena_, at the Island of _Cuba_, and in their Way took two Sloops, which they plundered, and let go; and off the Port fell in with a fine Galley, with 20 Guns, call'd the _John_ and _Martha_, Captain _Wilson_,
They put some of the Men ashore, and others they detain'd, as they had done several Times, to encrease their Company; but Captain _Martel_, charged Captain _Wilson_, to advise his Owners, that their Ship would answer his Purpose exactly, by taking one Deck
Having fitted up the aforesaid Ship, as they design'd, they mounted her with 22 Guns, 100 Men, and left 25 Hands in the Sloop, and so proceeded to Cruize off the _Leeward_ Islands, where they met with but too much Success.
After the taking of a Sloop and a Brigantine, they gave Chase to a stout Ship, which they came up with, and, at Sight of the Pyrate's Flag, she struck to the Robbers, being a Ship of 20 Guns, call'd the _Dolphin_, bound for _Newfoundland_.
Captain _Martel_ made the Men Prisoners, and carry'd the Ship with him.
The middle of _December_ the Pyrates took another Galley in her Voyage home from _Jamaica_, call'd the _Kent_, Captain _Lawton_, and shifted her Provisions aboard their own Ship, and let her go, which obliged her to Sail back to _Jamaica_ for a Supply for
After this they met with a small Ship and a Sloop, belonging to _Barbadoes_, out of both they took Provisions, and then parted with them, having first taken out some of their Hands, who were willing to be forced to go along with them.

Here they thought they might lye privately enough for some Time, and fit themselves for further Mischief.

The _Scarborough_ had bury'd twenty Men, and had near forty Sick, and therefore was but in ill State to go to Sea: However, Captain _Hume_ left his sick Men behind, and sailed to the other Islands, for a supply of Men, taking 20 Soldiers from _Antegoa_; at

A few Days after, _Teach_ fell in with the _Scarborogh_ Man of War, of 30 Guns, who engaged him for some Hours; but she finding the Pyrate well mann'd, and having tried her strength, gave over the Engagement, and returned to _Barbadoes_, the Place of her
In his Way he met with a Pyrate Sloop of ten Guns, commanded by one Major _Bonnet_, lately a Gentleman of good Reputation and Estate in the Island of _Barbadoes_, whom he joyned; but in a few Days after, _Teach_, finding that _Bonnet_ knew nothing of a

She was called the _Adventure_, from _Jamaica_, _David Harriot_ Master.
They took him and his Men aboard the great Ship, and sent a Number of other Hands with _Israel Hands_, Master of _Teach_'s Ship, to Man the Sloop for the pyratical Account.
The 9th of April, they weighed from _Turniff_, having lain there about a Week, and sailed to the Bay, where they found a Ship and four Sloops, three of the latter belonged to _Jonathan Bernard_, of _Jamaica_, and the other to Captain _James_; the Ship was
_Teach_ hoisted his Black Colours, and fired a Gun, upon which Captain _Wyar_ and all his Men, left their Ship, and got ashore in their Boat.
_Teach_'s Quarter-Master, and eight of his Crew, took Possession of _Wyar_'s Ship, and _Richards_ secured all the Sloops, one of which they burnt out of spight to the Owner; the _Protestant Cæsar_ they also burnt, after they had plundered her, because she
From hence the Rovers sailed to _Turkill_, and then to the _Grand Caimanes_, a small Island about thirty Leagues to the Westward of _Jamaica_, where they took a small Turtler, and so to the _Havana_, and from thence to the _Bahama_ Wrecks, and from the
They took here a Ship as she was coming out, bound for London, commanded by _Robert Clark_, with some Passengers on Board for _England_; the next Day they took another Vessel coming out of _Charles-Town_, and also two Pinks coming into _Charles-Town_;
They were eight Sail in the Harbour, ready for the Sea, but none dared to venture out, it being almost impossible to escape their Hands.
The inward bound Vessels were under the same unhappy Dilemma, so that the Trade of this Place was totally interrupted: What made these Misfortunes heavier to them, was a long expensive War, the Colony had had with the Natives, which was but just ended when
_Teach_ detained all the Ships and Prisoners, and, being in want of Medicines, resolves to demand a Chest from the Government of the Province; accordingly _Richards_, the Captain of the _Revenge_ Sloop, with two or three more Pyrates, were sent up along
Whilst Mr. _Marks_ was making Application to the Council, _Richards_, and the rest of the Pyrates, walk'd the Streets publickly, in the Sight of all People, who were fired with the utmost Indignation, looking upon them as Robbers and Murtherers, and
The Government were not long in deliberating upon the Message, tho' 'twas the greatest Affront that could have been put upon them; yet for the saving so many Mens Lives, (among them, Mr. _Samuel Wragg_, one of the Council;) they comply'd with the
_ and the Pyrates went back safe to their Ships.
_Blackbeard_, (for so _Teach_ was generally called, as we shall hereafter shew) as soon as he had received the Medicines and his Brother Rogues, let go the Ships and the Prisoners; having first taken out of them in Gold and Silver, about 1500 _l.
_ Sterling, besides Provisions and other Matters.
From the Bar of _Charles-Town_, they sailed to _North-Carolina_; Captain _Teach_ in the Ship, which they called the Man of War, Captain _Richards_ and Captain _Hands_ in the Sloops, which they termed Privateers, and another Sloop serving them as a Tender.
_Teach_ began now to think of breaking up the Company, and securing the Money and the best of the Effects for himself, and some others of his Companions he had most Friendship for, and to cheat the rest: Accordingly, on Pretence of running into _Topsail_
This done, _Teach_ goes into the Tender Sloop, with forty Hands, and leaves the _Revenge_ there; then takes seventeen others and Marroons them upon a small sandy Island, about a League from the Main, where there was neither Bird, Beast or Herb for their

The first Piece of Service this kind Governor did to _Black-Beard_, was, to give him a Right to the Vessel which he had taken, when he was a pyrating in the great Ship called the _Queen Ann's Revenge_; for which purpose, a Court of Vice-Admiralty was held
These Proceedings shew that Governors are but Men.
Before he sailed upon his Adventures, he marry'd a young Creature of about sixteen Years of Age, the Governor performing the Ceremony.
As it is a Custom to marry here by a Priest, so it is there by a Magistrate; and this, I have been informed, made _Teach_'s fourteenth Wife, whereof, about a dozen might be still living.
His Behaviour in this State, was something extraordinary; for, while his Sloop lay in _Okerecock_ Inlet, and he ashore at a Plantation, where his Wife lived, with whom after he had lain all Night, it was his Custom to invite five or six of his brutal
In _June_ 1718, he went to Sea, upon another Expedition, and steered his Course towards _Bermudas_; he met with two or three _English_ Vessels in his Way, but robbed them only of Provisions, Stores and other Necessaries, for his present Expence; but near
When _Teach_ and his Prize arrived, he and four of his Crew went to his Excellency, and made Affidavit, that they found the _French_ Ship at Sea, without a Soul on Board her; and then a Court was called, and the Ship condemned: The Governor had sixty
The Business was not yet done, the Ship remained, and it was possible one or other might come into the River, that might be acquainted with her, and so discover the Roguery; but _Teach_ thought of a Contrivance to prevent this, for, upon a Pretence that
Captain _Teach_, alias _Black-beard_, passed three or four Months in the River, sometimes lying at Anchor in the Coves, at other Times sailing from one Inlet to another, trading with such Sloops as he met, for the Plunder he had taken, and would often give
He often diverted himself with going ashore among the Planters, where he revelled Night and Day: By these he was well received, but whether out of Love or Fear, I cannot say; sometimes he used them courteously enough, and made them Presents of Rum and
At other Times he carried it in a lordly Manner towards them, and would lay some of them under Contribution; nay, he often proceeded to bully the Governor, not, that I can discover the least Cause of Quarrel betwixt them, but it seemed only to be done, to
The Sloops trading up and down this River, being so frequently pillaged by _Black-beard_, consulted with the Traders, and some of the best of the Planters, what Course to take; they, saw plainly it would be in vain to make any Application to the Governor
This Governor consulted with the Captains of the two Men of War, _viz.
_ the _Pearl_ and _Lime_, who had lain in St. _James_'s River, about ten Months.
It was agreed that the Governor should hire a couple of small Sloops, and the Men of War, should Man them; this was accordingly done, and the Command of them given to Mr. _Robert Maynard_, first Lieutenant of the _Pearl_, an experienced Officer, and a
The Sloops were well mann'd and furnished with Ammunition and small Arms, but had no Guns mounted.
About the Time of their going out, the Governor called an Assembly, in which it was resolved to publish a Proclamation, offering certain Rewards to any Person or Persons, who, within a Year after that Time, should take or destroy any Pyrate: The original
By his Majesty's Lieutenant Governor, and, Commander in Chief, of the Colony and Dominion of _Virginia_, A PROCLAMATION, Publishing the Rewards given for apprehending, or killing, Pyrates.
W_Hereas, by an Act of Assembly, made at a Session of Assembly, begun at the Capital in _Williamsburgh_, the eleventh Day of _November_, in the fifth Year of his Majesty's Reign, entituled, _An Act to encourage the apprehending and destroying of Pyrates_:
Wherefore, for the Encouragement of all such Persons as shall be willing to serve his Majesty, and their Country, in so just and honourable an Undertaking, as the suppressing a Sort of People, who may be truly called Enemies to Mankind: I have thought fit,
And, I do order and appoint this Proclamation, to be published by the Sheriffs, at their respective County-Houses, and by all Ministers and Readers, in the several Churches and Chappels, throughout this Colony.
_ Given at our Council-Chamber at _Williamsburgh_, this 24th Day of _November_, 1718, in the fifth Year of his Majesty's Reign.
GOD SAVE THE KING.
_A.
SPOTSWOOD_.
The 17th of _November_, 1718, the Lieutenant sail'd from _Kicquetan_, in _James_ River in _Virginia_, and, the 21st in the Evening, came to the Mouth of _Okerecock_ Inlet, where he got Sight of the Pyrate.
This Expedition was made with all imaginable Secrecy, and the Officer manag'd with all the Prudence that was necessary, stopping all Boats and Vessels he met with, in the River, from going up, and thereby preventing any Intelligence from reaching
_ These Men belonged to _Black-beard_, and were sent from _Bath-Town_ to _Okerecock_ Inlet, where the Sloop lay, which is about 20 Leagues.
_Black-beard_ had heard several Reports, which happened not to be true, and so gave the less Credit to this, nor was he convinced till he saw the Sloops: Whereupon he put his Vessel in a Posture of Defence; he had no more than twenty five Men on Board,
When he had prepared for Battle, he set down and spent the Night in drinking with the Master of a trading Sloop, who, 'twas thought, had more Business with _Teach_, than he should have had.
Lieutenant _Maynard_ came to an Anchor, for the Place being shoal, and the Channel intricate, there was no getting in, where _Teach_ lay, that Night; but in the Morning he weighed, and sent his Boat a-head of the Sloops to sound; and coming within Gun-Shot
_Black-beard_ cut his Cable, and endeavoured to make a running Fight, keeping a continual Fire at his Enemies, with his Guns; Mr. _Maynard_ not having any, kept a constant Fire with small Arms, while some of his Men laboured at their Oars.
In a little Time _Teach_'s Sloop ran a-ground, and Mr. _Maynard_'s drawing more Water than that of the Pyrate, he could not come near him; so he anchored within half Gun-Shot of the Enemy, and, in order to lighten his Vessel, that he might run him aboard,
And, from whence came you?
_ The Lieutenant made him Answer, _You may see by our Colours we are no Pyrates.
_ _Black-beard_ bid him send his Boat on Board, that he might see who he was; but Mr. _Maynard_ reply'd thus; _I cannot spare my Boat, but I will come aboard of you as soon as I can, with my Sloop.
_ Upon this, _Black-beard_ took a Glass of Liquor, and drank to him with these Words: _Damnation seize my Soul if I give you Quarters, or take any from you.
_ In Answer to which, Mr. _Maynard_ told him, _That he expected no Quarters from him, nor should he give him any.
_ By this time _Black-beard_'s Sloop fleeted, as Mr. _Maynard_'s Sloops were rowing towards him, which being not above a Foot high in the Waste, and consequently the Men all exposed, as they came near together, (there being hitherto little or no Execution
----A fatal Stroke to them!
The Sloop the Lieutenant was in, having twenty Men killed and wounded, and the other Sloop nine.
This could not be help'd, for there being no Wind, they were oblig'd to keep to their Oars, otherwise the Pyrate would have got away from him, which, it seems, the Lieutenant was resolute to prevent.
After this unlucky Blow, _Black-beard_'s Sloop fell Broadside to the Shore; Mr. _Maynard_'s other Sloop, which was called the _Ranger_, fell a-stern, being, for the present, disabled; so the Lieutenant finding his own Sloop had Way, and would soon be on
Mr. _Maynard_ was the only Person that kept the Deck, except the Man at the Helm, whom he directed to lye down snug, and the Men in the Hold were ordered to get their Pistols and their Swords ready for close fighting, and to come up at his Command; in
When the Lieutenant's Sloop boarded the other, Captain _Teach_'s Men threw in several new fashioned sort of Grenadoes, _viz.
_ Case Bottles fill'd with Powder, and small Shot, Slugs, and Pieces of Lead or Iron, with a quick Match in the Mouth of it, which being lighted without Side, presently runs into the Bottle to the Powder, and as it is instantly thrown on Board, generally
_ Whereupon, under the Smoak of one of the Bottles just mentioned, _Black-beard_ enters with fourteen Men, over the Bows of _Maynard_'s Sloop, and were not seen by him till the Air cleared; however, he just then gave a Signal to his Men, who all rose in an
They were now closely and warmly engaged, the Lieutenant and twelve Men, against _Black-beard_ and fourteen, till the Sea was tinctur'd with Blood round the Vessel; _Black-beard_ received a Shot into his Body from the Pistol that Lieutenant _Maynard_
At length, as he was cocking another Pistol, having fired several before, he fell down dead; by which Time eight more out of the fourteen dropp'd, and all the rest, much wounded, jump'd over-board, and call'd out for Quarters, which was granted, tho' it
The Sloop _Ranger_ came up, and attack'd the Men that remain'd in _Black-beard_'s Sloop, with equal Bravery, till they likewise cry'd for Quarters.
Here was an End of that couragious Brute, who might have pass'd in the World for a Heroe, had he been employ'd in a good Cause; his Destruction, which was of such Consequence to the Plantations, was entirely owing to the Conduct and Bravery of Lieutenant
The Broadside that did so much Mischief before they boarded, in all Probability saved the rest from Destruction; for before that _Teach_ had little or no Hopes of escaping, and therefore had posted a resolute Fellow, a Negroe whom he had bred up, with a
What seems a little odd, is, that some of these Men, who behaved so bravely against _Black-beard_, went afterwards a pyrating themselves, and one of them was taken along with _Roberts_; but I do not find that any of them were provided for, except one that
The Lieutenant caused _Black-beard_'s Head to be severed from his Body, and hung up at the Bolt-sprit End, then he sailed to _Bath-Town_, to get Relief for his wounded Men.
It must be observed, that in rummaging the Pyrate's Sloop, they found several Letters and written Papers, which discovered the Correspondence betwixt Governor _Eden_, the Secretary and Collector, and also some Traders at _New-York_, and _Black-beard_.
It is likely he had Regard enough for his Friends, to have destroyed these Papers before the Action, in order to hinder them from falling into such Hands, where the Discovery would be of no Use, either to the Interest or Reputation of these fine Gentlemen,
When the Lieutenant came to _Bath-Town_, he made bold to seize in the Governor's Store-House, the sixty Hogsheads of Sugar, and from honest Mr. _Knight_, twenty; which it seems was their Dividend of the Plunder taken in the _French_ Ship; the latter did
After the wounded Men were pretty well recover'd, the Lieutenant sailed back to the Men of War in _James River_, in _Virginia_, with _Black-beard_'s Head still hanging at the Bolt-sprit End, and fiveteen Prisoners, thirteen of whom were hanged.
It appearing upon Tryal, that one of them, _viz.
_ _Samuel Odell_, was taken out of the trading Sloop, but the Night before the Engagement.
This poor Fellow was a little unlucky at his first entering upon his new Trade, there appearing no less than 70 Wounds upon him after the Action, notwithstanding which, he lived, and was cured of them all.
The other Person that escaped the Gallows, was one _Israel Hands_, the Master of _Black-beard_'s Sloop, and formerly Captain of the same, before the _Queen Ann's Revenge_ was lost in _Topsail_ Inlet.
The aforesaid _Hands_ happened not to be in the Fight, but was taken afterwards ashore at _Bath-Town_, having been sometime before disabled by _Black-beard_, in one of his savage Humours, after the following Manner.
--One Night drinking in his Cabin with _Hands_, the Pilot, and another Man; _Black-beard_ without any Provocation privately draws out a small Pair of Pistols, and cocks them under the Table, which being perceived by the Man, he withdrew and went upon Deck,
When the Pistols were ready, he blew out the Candle, and crossing his Hands, discharged them at his Company; _Hands_, the Master, was shot thro' the Knee, and lam'd for Life; the other Pistol did no Execution.
--Being asked the meaning of this, he only answered, by damning them, that _if he did not now and then kill one of them, they would forget who he was.
_ _Hands_ being taken, was try'd and condemned, but just as he was about to be executed, a Ship arrives at _Virginia_ with a Proclamation for prolonging the Time of his Majesty's Pardon, to such of the Pyrates as should surrender by a limited Time therein
Now that we have given some Account of _Teach_'s Life and Actions, it will not be amiss, that we speak of his Beard, since it did not a little contribute towards making his Name so terrible in those Parts.
_Plutarch_, and other grave Historians have taken Notice, that several great Men amongst the _Romans_, took their Sir-Names from certain odd Marks in their Countenances; as _Cicero_, from a Mark or Vetch on his Nose; so our Heroe, Captain _Teach_, assumed
This Beard was black, which he suffered to grow of an extravagant Length; as to Breadth, it came up to his Eyes; he was accustomed to twist it with Ribbons, in small Tails, after the Manner of our Ramilies Wiggs, and turn them about his Ears: In Time of
If he had the look of a Fury, his Humours and Passions were suitable to it; we shall relate two or three more of his Extravagancies, which we omitted in the Body of his History, by which it will appear, to what a Pitch of Wickedness, human Nature may
In the Commonwealth of Pyrates, he who goes the greatest Length of Wickedness, is looked upon with a kind of Envy amongst them, as a Person of a more extraordinary Gallantry, and is thereby entitled to be distinguished by some Post, and if such a one has
The Hero of whom we are writing, was thoroughly accomplished this Way, and some of his Frolicks of Wickedness, were so extravagant, as if he aimed at making his Men believe he was a Devil incarnate; for being one Day at Sea, and a little flushed with
The Night before he was killed, he set up and drank till the Morning, with some of his own Men, and the Master of a Merchant-Man, and having had Intelligence of the two Sloops coming to attack him, as has been before observed; one of his Men asked him, in
He answered, _That no Body but himself and the Devil, knew where it was, and the longest Liver should take all.
_ Those of his Crew who were taken alive, told a Story which may appear a little incredible; however, we think it will not be fair to omit it, since we had it from their own Mouths.
That once upon a Cruize, they found out that they had a Man on Board more than their Crew; such a one was seen several Days amongst them, sometimes below, and sometimes upon Deck, yet no Man in the Ship could give an Account who he was, or from whence he
One would think these Things should induce them to reform their Lives, but so many Reprobates together, encouraged and spirited one another up in their Wickedness, to which a continual Course of drinking did not a little contribute; for in _Black-beard_'s
-- _Such a Day, Rum all out:--Our Company somewhat sober:--A damn'd Confusion amongst us!
--Rogues a plotting;--great Talk of Separation.
--So I look'd sharp for a Prize;--such a Day took one, with a great deal of Liquor on Board, so kept the Company hot, damned hot, then all Things went well again.
_ Thus it was these Wretches passed their Lives, with very little Pleasure or Satisfaction, in the Possession of what they violently take away from others, and sure to pay for it at last, by an ignominious Death.
The Names of the Pyrates killed in the Engagement, are as follow.
_Edward Teach_, Commander.
_Phillip Morton_, Gunner.
_Garrat Gibbens_, Boatswain.
_Owen Roberts_, Carpenter.

OF Major _Stede Bonnet_, And his CREW.
THE Major was a Gentleman of good Reputation in the Island of _Barbadoes_, was Master of a plentiful Fortune, and had the Advantage of a liberal Education.
He had the least Temptation of any Man to follow such a Course of Life, from the Condition of his Circumstances.
It was very surprizing to every one, to hear of the Major's Enterprize, in the Island were he liv'd; and as he was generally esteem'd and honoured, before he broke out into open Acts of Pyracy, so he was afterwards rather pitty'd than condemned, by those
However, he fitted out a Sloop with ten Guns and 70 Men, entirely at his own Expence, and in the Night-Time sailed from _Barbadoes_.
He called his Sloop the _Revenge_; his first Cruize was off the Capes of _Virginia_, where he took several Ships, and plundered them of their Provisions, Cloaths, Money, Ammunition, _&c.
_ in particular the _Anne_, Captain _Montgomery_, from _Glascow_; the _Turbet_ from _Barbadoes_, which for Country sake, after they had taken out the principal Part of the Lading, the Pyrate Crew set her on Fire; the _Endeavour_, Captain _Scot_, from
From hence they went to _New-York_, and off the East End of _Long-Island_, took a Sloop bound for the _West-Indies_, after which they stood in and landed some Men at _Gardner_'s _Island_, but in a peaceable Manner, and bought Provisions for the Company's
Some Time after, which was in _August_ 1717, _Bonnet_ came off the Bar of _South-Carolina_, and took a Sloop and a Brigantine bound in; the Sloop belonged to _Barbadoes, Joseph Palmer_ Master, laden with Rum, Sugar and Negroes; and the Brigantine came from
After the Sloop had cleaned, they put to Sea, but came to no Resolution what Course to take; the Crew were divided in their Opinions, some being for one Thing, and some another, so that nothing but Confusion seem'd to attend all their Schemes.
The Major was no Sailor as was said before, and therefore had been obliged to yield to many Things that were imposed on him, during their Undertaking, for want of a competent Knowledge in maritime Affairs; at length happening to fall in Company with
To him _Bonnet_'s Crew joined in Consortship, and _Bonnet_ himself was laid aside, notwithstanding the Sloop was his own; he went aboard _Black-beard_'s Ship, not concerning himself with any of their Affairs, where he continued till she was lost in
The Major now saw his Folly, but could not help himself, which made him Melancholy; he reflected upon his past Course of Life, and was confounded with Shame, when he thought upon what he had done: His Behaviour was taken Notice of by the other Pyrates, who
When _Black-beard_ lost his Ship at _Topsail_ Inlet, and surrendered to the King's Proclamation, _Bonnet_ reassumed the Command of his own Sloop, _Revenge_, goes directly away to _Bath-Town_ in _North-Carolina_, surrenders likewise to the King's Pardon,
The War was now broke out between the _Tripple_ Allies and _Spain_; so Major _Bonnet_ gets a Clearence for his Sloop at _North-Carlina_, to go to the Island of St. _Thomas_, with a Design (at least it was pretended so) to get the Emperor's Commission, to
When _Bonnet_ came back to _Topsail_ Inlet, he found that _Teach_ and his Gang were gone, and that they had taken all the Money, small Arms and Effects of Value out of the great Ship, and set ashore on a small sandy Island above a League from the Main,
Major _Bonnet_ told all his Company, that he would take a Commission to go against the _Spaniards_, and to that End, was going to St. _Thomas_'s therefore if they would go with him, they should be welcome; whereupon they all consented, but as the Sloop was
_Bonnet_, who bore him a mortal Hatred for some Insults offered him, went immediately in pursuit of _Black-beard_, but it happened too late, for he missed of him there, and after four Days Cruize, hearing no farther News of him, they steered their Course
In the Month of _July_, these Adventurers came off the Capes, and meeting with a Pink with a Stock of Provisions on Board, which they happened to be in Want of, they took out of her ten or twelve Barrels of Pork, and about 400 Weight of Bread; but because
Two Days afterwards they chased a Sloop of sixty Ton, and took her two Leagues off of Cape _Henry_; they were so happy here as to get a Supply of Liquor to their Victuals, for they brought from her two Hogsheads of Rum, and as many of Molosses, which, it
After this, the Major threw off all Restraint, and though he had just before received his Majesty's Mercy, in the Name of _Stede Bonnet_, he relaps'd in good Earnest into his old Vocation, by the Name of Captain _Thomas_, and recommenced a down-right
The next Day they took a small Sloop bound from _Virginia_ to _Bermudas_, which supply'd them with twenty Barrels of Pork, some Bacon, and they gave her in return, two Barrels of Rice, and a Hogshead of Molossus; out of this Sloop two Men enter'd
The next they took was another _Virginia_ Man, bound to _Glascow_, out of which they had nothing of Value, save only a few Combs, Pins and Needles, and gave her instead thereof, a Barrel of Pork, and two Barrels of Bread.
From _Virginia_ they sailed to _Philadelphia_, and in the Latitude of 38 North, they took a Scooner, coming from _North-Carolina_, bound to _Boston_, they had out of her only two Dozen of Calf-Skins, to make Covers for Guns, and two of their Hands, and
All this was but small Game, and seem'd as if they design'd only to make Provision for their Sloop against they arrived at St. _Thomas_'s; for they hitherto had dealt favourably with all that were so unhappy as so fall into their Hands; but those that came
The 29th Day of _July_, Captain _Thomas_ took a Sloop of 50 Tons, six or seven Leagues off _Delaware_ Bay, bound from _Philadelphia_ to _Barbadoes, Thomas Read_ Master, loaden with Provisions, which they kept, and put four or five of their Hands on Board
The last Day of _July_, they took another Sloop of 60 Tons, commanded by _Peter Manwaring_, bound from _Antegoa_ to _Philadelphia_, which they likewise kept with all the Cargo, consisting chiefly of Rum, Molosses, Sugar, Cotton, Indigo, and about 25 Pound
The last Day of _July_, our Rovers with the Vessels last taken, left _Delaware_ Bay, and sailed to Cape _Fear_ River, where they staid too long for their Safety, for the Pyrate Sloop which they now new named the _Royal James_, proved very leaky, so that
Upon this Information, the Council of _South-Carolina_ was alarmed, and apprehended they should receive another Visit from them speedily; to prevent which, Colonel _William Rhet_, of the same Province, waited on the Governor, and generously offered himself
In a few Days two Sloops were equipped and manned: The _Henry_ with 8 Guns and 70 Men, commanded by Captain _John Masters_, and the _Sea Nymph_, with 8 Guns and 60 Men, commanded by Captain _Fayrer Hall_, both under the entire Direction and Command of the
Just then arrived a small Ship from _Antigoa_, one _Cock_ Master, with an Account, that in Sight of the Bar he was taken and plundered by one _Charles Vane_, a Pyrate, in a Brigantine of 12 Guns and 90 Men; and who had also taken two other Vessels bound in
This prov'd fortunate to the Owners of the _Guiney_ Man, for _Yeats_ having often attempted to quit this Course of Life, took an Opportunity in the Night, to leave _Vane_ and to run into _North-Edisto_ River, to the Southward of _Charles-Town_, and
The Owners got their Negroes, and _Yeats_ and his Men had Certificates given them from the Government.
_Vane_ cruised some Time off the Bar, in hopes to catch _Yeats_, and unfortunately for them, took two Ships coming out, bound to _London_, and while the Prisoners were aboard, some of the Pyrates gave out, that they designed to go into one of the Rivers to
Colonel _Rhet_, upon hearing this, sailed over the Bar the 15th of _September_, with the two Sloops before mentioned; and having the Wind Northerly, went after the Pyrate _Vane_, and scoured the Rivers and Inlets to the Southward; but not meeting with him,
On the 26th following, in the Evening, the Colonel with his small Squadron, entered the River, and saw, over a Point of Land, three Sloops at an Anchor, which were Major _Bonnet_ and his Prizes; but it happened that in going up the River, the Pilot run the
The Pyrates soon discovered the Sloops, but not knowing who they were, or upon what Design they came into that River, they manned three Canoes, and sent them down to take them, but they quickly found their Mistake, and returned to the Sloop, with the
Major _Bonnet_ made Preparations that Night for engaging, and took all the Men out of the Prizes.
He shewed Captain _Manwaring_, one of his Prisoners, a Letter, he had just wrote, which he declared he would send to the Governor of _Carolina_; the Letter was to this Effect, _viz.
That if the Sloops, which then appeared, were sent out against him, by the said Governor, and he should get clear off, that he would burn and destroy all Ships or Vessels going in or coming out of_ South-Carolina.
The next Morning they got under Sail, and came down the River, designing only a running Fight.
Colonel _Rhet_'s Sloops got likewise under Sail, and stood for him, getting upon each Quarter of the Pyrate, with Intent to board him; which he perceiving, edged in towards the Shore, and being warmly engaged, their Sloop ran a-ground: The _Carolina_
At this Time the Pyrate had a considerable Advantage; for their Sloop, after she was a-ground, listed from Colonel _Rhet_'s, by which Means they were all covered, and the Colonel's Sloop listing the same Way, his Men were much exposed; notwithstanding
The Pyrates made a Wiff in their bloody Flag, and beckoned several Times with their Hats in Derision to the Colonel's Men, to come on Board, which they answered with chearful Huzza's, and said, _that they would speak with them by and by_; which accordingly
The Colonel took Possession of the Sloop, and was extreamly pleased to find that Captain _Thomas_, who commanded her, was the individual Person of Major _Stede Bonnet_, who had done them the Honour several Times to visit their own Coast of _Carolina_.
There were killed in this Action, on Board the _Henry_, ten Men, and fourteen wounded; on Board the _Sea Nymph_, two killed and four wounded.
The Officers and Sailors in both Sloops behaved themselves with the greatest Bravery; and had not the Sloops so unluckily run a-ground, they had taken the Pyrate with much less loss of Men; but as he designed to get by them, and so make a running Fight,
Of the Pyrates there were seven killed and five wounded, two of which died soon after of their Wounds.
Colonel _Rhet_ weigh'd the 30th of _September_, from Cape _Fear_ River, and arrived at _Charles-Town_ the 3d of _October_, to the great Joy of the whole Province of _Carolina_.
_Bonnet_ and his Crew, two Days after, were put ashore, and there not being a publick Prison, the Pyrates were kept at the Watch-House, under a Guard of Militia; but Major _Bonnet_ was committed into the Custody of the Marshal, at his House; and in a few
This made a great Noise in the Province, and People were open in their Resentments, often reflecting on the Governor, and others in the Magistracy, as tho' they had been brib'd, for conniving at their Escape.
These Invectives arose from their Fears, that _Bonnet_ would be capable of raising another Company, and prosecute his Revenge against this Country, for what he had lately, tho' justly, suffered: But they were in a short Time made easy in those Respects;
_Bonnet_ stood to the Northward, in a small Vessel, but wanting Necessaries, and the Weather being bad, he was forced back, and so return'd with his Canoe, to _Swillivants_ Island, near _Charles-Town_, to fetch Supplies; but there being some Information
Bonnet_ submitted, and surrender'd himself; and the next Morning, being _November_ the 6th, was brought by Colonel _Rhet_ to _Charles-Town_, and, by the Governor's Warrant, was committed into safe Custody, in order for his being brought to his Tryal.
On the 28th of _October_, 1718, a Court of Vice-Admiralty was held at _Charles-Town_, in _South-Carolina_, and, by several Adjournments, continued to _Wednesday_, the 12th of _November_ following, for the Tryal of the Pyrates taken in a Sloop formerly
The King's Commission to Judge _Trot_ was read, and a Grand Jury sworn, for the finding of the several Bills, and a learned Charge given them by the said Judge, wherein he 1st shewed, _That the Sea was given by God, for the Use of Men, and is Subject to

3dly, He observed, _that as Commerce and Navigation could not be carried on without Laws; so there have been always particular Laws, for the better ordering and regulating marine Affairs_; with an historical Account or those Laws, and Origine.
4thly, He proceeded to shew, _that there have been particular Courts and Judges appointed; to whose Jurisdiction maritime Causes do belong, and that in Matters both Civil and Criminal_.
And then 5thly, He particularly shewed them, _the Constitution and Jurisdiction of that Court of Admiralty Sessions_.
And lastly, _the Crimes cognizable therein_; and particularly enlarged _upon the Crime of Pyracy_, which was then brought before them.
The Indictments being found, a petit Jury was sworn, and the following Persons arraigned and tried.

This was the Form of the Indictments they were arraigned upon, and tho' they might have proved several more Facts upon the major Part of the Crew, the Court thought fit to prosecute but two; the other was for seizing in a pyratical and felonious Manner,
All the Prisoners arraigned, pleaded Not Guilty, and put themselves upon their Tryals, except _James Wilson_, and _John Levit_, who pleaded Guilty to both Indictments, and _Daniel Perry_, to one only.
The Major would have gone through both the Indictments at once, which the Court not admitting, he pleaded Not Guilty to both Indictments, but being convicted of one, he retracted his former Plea to the second Indictment, and pleaded Guilty to it.
The Prisoners made little or no Defence, every one pretending only that they were taken off a Maroon Shore, and were shipped with Major _Bonnet_ to go to St. _Thomas_'s; but being out at Sea, and wanting Provisions, they were obliged to do what they did by
However, the Facts being plainly proved, and that they had all shared ten or eleven Pounds a Man, excepting the three last, and _Thomas Nichols_, they were all but they, found Guilty.
The Judge made a very grave Speech to them, setting forth _the Enormity of their Crimes, the Condition they were now in, and the Nature and Necessity of an unfeigned Repentance_; and then recommended them to the Ministers of the Province, for more ample

_The Lord Chief Justices's_ SPEECH, _upon his pronouncing Sentence on Major_ STEDE BONNET.
MAjor _Stede Bonnet_, you stand here convicted upon two Indictments of Pyracy; one by the Verdict of the Jury, and the other by your own Confession.
Altho' you were indicted but for _two_ Facts, yet you know that at your Tryal it was fully proved even by an unwilling Witness, that you _pyratically_ took and rifled no less than _thirteen_ Vessels, since you sail'd from _North-Carolina_.
So that you might have been indicted, and convicted of _eleven_ more Acts of _Pyracy_, since you took the Benefit of the King's _Act of Grace_, and pretended to leave that wicked Course of Life.
Not to mention the many _Acts_ of _Pyracy_ you committed before; for which if your Pardon from _Man_ was never so authentick, yet you must expect to answer for them before God.
You know that the Crimes you have committed are _evil_ in themselves, and contrary to the _Light_ and _Law_ of _Nature_, as well as the _Law_ of God, by which you are commanded that _you shall not steal_, Exod.
20.
15.
And the Apostle St. _Paul_ expresly affirms, That _Thieves shall not inherit the Kingdom of God_, 1 Cor.
6.
10.
But to _Theft_ you have added a greater Sin, which is _Murder_.
How many you may have _killed_ of those that resisted you in the committing your former _Pyracies_, I know not: But this we all know, That besides the Wounded, you kill'd no less than _eighteen_ Persons out of those that were sent by lawful Authority to
And however you may fancy that that was killing Men fairly in open _Fight_, yet this know, that the Power of the _Sword_ not being committed into your Hands by any lawful Authority, you were not impowered to use any _Force_, or _fight_ any one; and

Assoon as _Skinner_ had struck to the Pyrate, he was ordered to come on Board in his Boat, which he did, and the Person that he first cast his Eye upon, proved to be his old Boatswain, who star'd him in the Face like his evil Genius, and accosted him in

_Is it you?
The only Man I wished to see; I am much in your Debt, and now I shall pay you all in your own Coin_.

_ 16, 1720.
W_E arrived the_ 25_th of_ July _last, in Company of the_ Greenwich, _at_ Juanna, (_an Island not far from_ Madagascar) _putting in there to refresh our Men, we found fourteen Pyrates that came in their Canoes from the_ Mayotta, _where the Pyrate Ship to

_ Oliver de la Bouche, _bound from the_ Guinea _Coast to the_ East-Indies, _had been bulged and lost.
They said they left the Captain and_ 40 _of their Men building a new Vessel to proceed on their wicked Design.
Capt.
_ Kirby _and I concluding it might be of great Service to the_ East-India _Company to destroy such a Nest of Rogues, were ready to sail for that Purpose the_ 17_th of_ August, _about Eight o'Clock in the Morning, when we discovered two Pyrate Ships
I immediately went on Board the_ Greenwich, _where they seem'd very diligent in Preparations for an Engagement, and I left Capt.
_ Kirby _with mutual Promises of standing by each other.
I then unmoor'd, got under Sail, and brought two Boats a-head to row me close to the_ Greenwich; _but he being open to a Valley and a Breeze, made the best of his Way from me; which an_ Ostender _in our Company, of_ 22 _Guns, seeing, did the same, though
_ Kirby _had kept his.
About half an Hour after Twelve, I called several times to the_ Greenwich _to bear down to our Assistance, and fir'd Shot at him, but to no Purpose.
For tho' we did not doubt but he would join us, because when he got about a League from us, he brought his Ship to, and look'd on, yet both he and the_ Ostender _basely deserted us, and left us engaged with barbarous and inhuman Enemies, with their black
But God, in his good Providence, determin'd otherwise; for notwithstanding their Superiority, we engaged 'em both about three Hours, during which, the biggest received some Shot betwixt Wind and Water, which made her keep off a little to stop her Leaks.
The other endeavoured all she could to board us, by rowing with her Oars, being within half a Ship's Length of us above an Hour; but by good Fortune we shot all her Oars to Pieces, which prevented them, and by consequence saved our Lives_.
_About Four o'Clock, most of the Officers and Men posted on the Quarter-Deck being killed and wounded, the largest Ship making up to us with all Diligence, being still within a Cable's Length of us, often giving us a Broadside, and no hopes of Capt.
_ Kirby_'s coming to our Assistance, we endeavoured to run ashoar; and tho' we drew four Foot Water more than the Pyrate, it pleased God that he stuck fast on a higher Ground than we happily fell in with; so was disappointed a second time from boarding us.
Here we had a more violent Engagement than before.
All my Officers, and most of my Men, behaved with unexpected Courage; and as we had a considerable Advantage by having a Broadside to his Bow, we did him great Damage, so that had Capt.
_ Kirby _come in then, I believe we should have taken both, for we had one of them sure; but the other Pyrate_ (_who was still firing at us_) _seeing the_ Greenwich _did not offer to assist us, he supplied his Consort with three Boats full of fresh Men.
About Five in the Evening the_ Greenwich _stood clear away to Sea, leaving us struggling hard for Life in the very Jaws of Death; which the other Pyrate, that was afloat, seeing, got a-warp out, and was hauling under our Stern; by which time many of my Men
When the Pyrates came aboard, they cut three of our wounded Men to Pieces.
I, with a few of my People, made what haste I could to the_ King's-Town, _twenty five Miles from us, where I arrived next Day, almost dead with Fatigue and Loss of Blood, having been sorely wounded in the Head by a Musket Ball_.
_At this Town I heard that the Pyrates had offered ten thousand Dollars to the Country People to bring me in, which many of them would have accepted, only they knew the King and all his chief People were in my Interest.
Mean time, I caused a Report to be spread, that I was dead of my Wounds, which much abated their Fury.
About ten Days after, being pretty well recovered, and hoping the Malice of our Enemies was nigh over, I began to consider the dismal Condition we were reduced to, being in a Place where we had no Hopes of getting a Passage home, all of us in a manner

_They sailed the_ 3_d of_ September; _and with Jury-Masts, and such old Sails as they left me, I made shift to do the like on the_ 8_th, together with forty three of my Ship's Crew, including two Passengers and twelve Soldiers, having but five Tons of
--_We had in all thirteen Men killed and twenty four wounded; and we were told, that we had destroyed about ninety or a hundred of the Pyrates.
When they left us, they were about three hundred Whites and eighty Blacks in both Ships.
I am persuaded, had our Consort the_ Greenwich _done his Duty, we had destroyed both of them, and got two hundred thousand Pounds for our Owners and selves; whereas to his deserting us, the Loss of the_ Cassandra _may justly be imputed.
I have delivered all the Bales that were given me into the Company's Warehouse, for which the Governor and Council have ordered me a Reward.
Our Governor, Mr._ Boon, _who is extreme kind and civil to me, has ordered me home with this Pacquet; but Captain_ Harvey, _who had a prior Promise, being come in with the Fleet, goes in my room.
The Governor hath promis'd me a Country Voyage, to help make me up my Losses, and would have me stay to go home with him next Year_.

_England_ was inclined to favour Captain _Mackra_; but he was so free to let him know, that his Interest was declining amongst them; and that the Pyrates were so provoked at the Resistance he made against them, that he was afraid he should hardly be able
_Mackra_ did what he could to soften this Beast, and ply'd him with warm Punch; notwithstanding which, they were in a Tumult whether they should make an End of him, or no, when an Accident happen'd which turn'd to the Favour of the poor Captain; a Fellow
This put an End to the Dispute, and Captain _Taylor_ was so mellow'd with the Punch, that he consented that the old Pyrate Ship, and so many Bales of Cloth should be given to Captain _Mackra_, and so he fell asleep.
_England_ advised Captain _Mackra_ to get off with all Expedition, least when the Beast should awake, he might repent his Generosity: Which Advice was followed by the Captain.

It was in 1722, resettled by the _French_, who have a Fort at another neighbouring Island, called _Don Mascarine_, and are touched at for Water, Wood, and Refreshments, by _French_ Ships bound to, or for _India_; as St. _Helena_ and _Cape Bon Esperance_,
From this Place, Captain _England_ and his Companions having made a little Boat of Staves and old Pieces of Deal left there, went over to _Madagascar_, where they subsist at present on the Charity of some of their Brethren, who had made better Provision
The Pyrates detained some Officers and Men belonging to Captain _Mackra_, and having repaired the Damages received in their Rigging, they sailed for _India_.
The Day before they made Land, saw two Ships to the Eastward, who at first Sight, they took to be _English_, and ordered one of the Prisoners, who had been an Officer with Captain _Mackra_, to tell them the private Signals between the Company's Ships, the
While they lay at an Anchor, and were all the next Day employed in taking out Water, one of the aforementioned Fleet bore towards them with _English_ Colours, answered with a red Ensign from the Pyrates, but did not speak with one another.
At Night they left the _Muscatt_ Ships, weighed with the Sea Wind, and stood to the Northward after this Fleet: About four next Morning, just as they were getting under sail, with the Land Wind, the Pyrates came amongst them, made no stop, but fired their

The same Day they chased another Gallivat and took her, being come from _Gogo_, bound for _Callicut_ with Cotton.
Of these Men they enquired concerning the Fleet, supposing they must have been in it; and altho' they protested they had not seen a Ship or Boat since they left _Gogo_, and pleaded very earnestly for Favour; yet they threw all their Cargo over-board, and
For the better elucidating of this Story, it may be convenient to inform the Reader, who _Angria_ is, and what the Fleet were, that had so scurvily behaved themselves.
_Angria_ is a famous _Indian_ Pyrate, of considerable Strength and Territories, that gives continual Disturbance to the _European_ (and especially the _English_) Trade: His chief Hold is _Callaba_, not many Leagues from _Bombay_, and has one Island in
It would not be so insuperable a Difficulty to suppress him, if the Shallowness of the Water did not prevent Ships of War coming nigh: And a better Art he has, of bribing the _Mogul_'s Ministers for Protection, when he finds an Enemy too powerful.

This favourable Opportunity of destroying the Pyrates, angered the Governor, and he transferred the Command of the Fleet to Captain _Mackra_, who had Orders immediately to pursue and engage, where ever he met them.
The Vice-Roy of _Goa_, assisted by the _English_ Company's Fleet from _Bombay_, did attempt the Reduction of _Callaba_, his principal Place, landed 8 or 10000 Men the next Year, the _English_ Squadron of Men of War being then in those Seas; but having

The Women they forced in a Barbarous Manner to their Lusts, and to require them, destroyed their Cocoa Trees, and fired several of their Houses and _Churches_.

Thence they proceeded to _Calicut_, where they endeavoured to take a large _Moor_ Ship out of the Road, but was prevented by some Guns mounted on Shore, and discharged at them: Mr. _Lasinby_, who was one of Captain _Mackra_'s Officers, and detained, was

The next Day in their Passage down, came up with a _Dutch_ Galliot, bound for _Calicut_ with Lime Stone, and aboard of her they put Captain _Tawke_, and sent him away, and several of the People interceeded for _Lasinby_ in vain, _For_, says _Taylor_ and
It was but one Day more before they arrived off _Cochin_, where, by a Fishing-Canoe, they sent a Letter on Shore; and in the Afternoon, with the Sea-breeze, ran into the Road and anchored, saluting the Fort with 11 Guns each Ship, and received the Return,
They had not been long at Anchor again, before they had several Canoes on Board with both black and white Inhabitants, who continued, without Interruption, all good Offices, during their Stay; particularly _John Trumpet_ brought a large Boat of Arrack,
When they had all on Board, they paid Mr. _Trumpet_ to his Satisfaction, it was computed, 6 or 7000 _l.

That Night being little Wind, did not weigh, and _Trumpet_, in the Morning, waked them to the Sight of more Arrack, Chests of Piece-Goods, and ready made Clothes, bringing the Fiscal of the Place also with him.
At Noon, while those were on Board, saw a Sail to the Southward, which they weighed, and chaced after; but she having a good Offing, got to the Northward of them, and anchored a small Distance from _Cochin_ Fort; the aforementioned Gentlemen assuring them,
This Governor is an Emblem of foreign Power.
What Inconvenience and Injury must the Master's Subjects sustain under one who can truckle to such treacherous and base Means, as corresponding and trading with Pyrates to enrich himself?
Certainly such a Man will stickle at no Injustice to repair or make a Fortune.
He has the _Argumentum bacillum_ always in his own Hands, and can convince, when he pleases, in half the Time of other Arguments, that Fraud and Oppression is Law.
That he imploys Instruments in such dirty Work, expresses the Guilt and Shame, but no way mitigates the Crime.
_John Trumpet_ was the Tool; but, as the Dog said in the Fable, on another Occasion, _What is done by the Master's Orders, is the Master's Actions_.

OF Captain _Charles Vane_, And his CREW.
C_Harles Vane_ was one of those who stole away the Silver which the _Spaniards_ had fished up from the Wrecks of the Galleons, in the Gulph of _Florida_, and was at _Providence_ (as has been before hinted) when Governor _Rogers_ arrived there with two Men
All the Pyrates who were found at this Colony of Rogues, submitted, and received Certificates of their Pardon, except Captain _Vane_ and his Crew; who, as soon as they saw the Men of War enter, slipp'd their Cable, set Fire to a Prize they had in the
Two Days after they went out, they met with a Sloop belonging to _Barbadoes_, which they made Prize of, and kept the Vessel for their own Use, putting aboard five and twenty Hands, with one _Yeats_ to command them.
A Day or two afterwards they fell in with a small interloping Trader, with a Quantity of _Spanish_ Pieces of Eight aboard, bound into _Providence_, called the _John_ and _Elizabeth_, which they also took along with them.
With these two Sloops _Vane_ went to a small Island and cleaned; where they shared their Booty, and spent some Time in a riotous Manner of Living, as is the Custom of Pyrates.
The latter End of _May_ 1718, they sail'd, and being in want of Provisions, they beat up for the Windward Islands, and met with a _Spanish_ Sloop bound from _Porto Rico_ to the _Havana_, which they burnt, and stowed the _Spaniards_ in a Boat, and left them
But steering between St. _Christopher_'s and _Anguilla_, they fell in with a Brigantine and a Sloop, with the Cargo they wanted; from whom they got Provisions for Sea-Store.
Sometime after this, standing to the Northward, in the Track the _Old-England_ Ships take, in their Voyage to the _American_ Colonies, they took several Ships and Vessels, which they plundered of what they thought fit, and let them pass.
The latter End of _August, Vane_, with his Consort _Yeats_, came off _South-Carolina_, and took a Ship belonging to _Ipswich_, one _Coggershall_ Commander, laden with Logwood, which was thought convenient enough for their own Business, and therefore
In this Cruize the Rover took several other Ships and Vessels, particularly a Sloop from _Barbadoes, Dill_ Master; a small Ship from _Antegoa, Cock_ Master; a Sloop belonging to _Curacco, Richards_ Master; and a large Brigantine, Captain _Thompson_, from
The Pyrates plundered them all and let them go, putting the Negroes out of the Brigantine aboard of _Yeat_'s Vessel, by which Means they came back again to the right Owners.
For Captain _Vane_, having always treated his Consort with very little Respect, assuming a Superiority over _Yeats_ and his small Crew, and regarding the Vessel but as a Tender to his own; gave them a Disgust, who thought themselves as good Pyrates, and as
A Day or two afterwards, the Pyrates lying off at Anchor, _Yeats_ in the Evening slipp'd his Cable, and put his Vessel under Sail, standing into the Shore; which, when _Vane_ saw, he was highly provoked, and got his Sloop under Sail to chase his Consort,
_Yeats_ came into _North Edisto_ River, about ten Leagues Southward of _Charles-Town_, and sent an Express to the Governor, to know if he and his Comrades might have the Benefit of his Majesty's Pardon, and they would surrender themselves to his Mercy,
_Vane_ cruised some Time off the Bar, in hopes to catch _Yeats_ at his coming out again, but therein he was disappointed; however, he unfortunately for them, took two Ships from _Charles-Town_, bound home to _England_.
It happen'd that just at this Time two Sloops well mann'd and arm'd, were equipp'd to go after a Pyrate, which the Governor of _South-Carolina_ was informed, lay then in Cape _Fear_ River, a cleaning: But Colonel _Rhet_, who commanded the Sloops, meeting
Colonel _Rhet_'s speaking with this Ship, was the most unlucky Thing that could have happened, because it turned him out of the Road, which in all Probability, would have brought him into the Company of _Vane_, as well as of the Pyrate he went after; and
Captain _Vane_ went into an Inlet to the Northward, where he met with Captain _Thatch_, or _Teach_, otherwise call'd _Black-beard_, whom he saluted (when he found who he was) with his great Guns, loaded with Shot, (as is the Custom among Pyrates when they
On the 23d of _October_, off of _Long Island_, he took a small Brigantine, bound from _Jamaica_ to _Salem_ in _New-England, John Shattock_ Master, and a little Sloop; they rifled the Brigantine, and sent her away.
From hence they resolved on a Cruize between Cape _Meise_ and Cape _Nicholas_, where they spent some Time, without seeing or speaking with any Vessel, till the latter End of _November_; then they fell upon a Ship, which 'twas expected would have struck as
_Vane_ desired to have nothing further to say to her, but trimm'd his Sails, and stood away from the _French_ Man; but _Monsieur_ having a Mind to be better informed who he was, set all his Sails, and crowded after him.
During this Chace, the Pyrates were divided in their Resolutions what to do: _Vane_, the Captain, was for making off as fast as he could, alledging the Man of War was too strong to cope with; but one _John Rackam_, who was an Officer, that had a kind of a

The Mate, one _Robert Deal_, was of _Vane_'s Opinion, as were about fifteen more, and all the rest joined with _Rackam_, the Quarter-Master.
At length the Captain made use of his Power to determine this Dispute, which, in these Cases, is absolute and uncontroulable, by their own Laws, _viz_.
in _fighting, chasing_, or _being chased_; in all other Matters whatsoever, he is governed by a Majority; so the Brigantine having the Heels, as they term it, of the _French_ Man, she came clear off.
But the next Day, the Captain's Behaviour was obliged to stand the Test of a Vote, and a Resolution passed against his Honour and Dignity, branding him with the Name of Coward, deposing him from the Command, and turning him out of the Company, with Marks
They had with them a small Sloop that had been taken by them some Time before, which they gave to _Vane_, and the discarded Members; and, that they might be in a Condition to provide for themselves, by their own honest Endeavours, they let them have a
_John Rackam_ was voted Captain of the Brigantine, in _Vane_'s Room, and proceeded towards the _Caribbee Islands_, where we must leave him, till we have finished our Story of _Charles Vane_.
The Sloop sailed for the Bay of _Honduras_, and _Vane_ and his Crew put her into as good a Condition as they could by the Way, to follow the old Trade.
They cruised two or three Days off the North-West Part of _Jamaica_, and took a Sloop and two Pettiagas, and all the Men entered with them; the Sloop they kept, and _Robert Deal_ went Captain of her.
On the 16th of _December_ the two Sloops came into the Bay, where they found only one at an Anchor, call'd the _Pearl_, of _Jamaica_, Captain _Charles Rowling_ Master, who got under Sail at the Sight of them; but the Pyrate Sloops coming near _Rowling_,

He lived here some Weeks, and was subsisted chiefly by Fishermen, who frequented the Island with small Craft, from the Main, to catch Turtles, _&c_.
While _Vane_ was upon this Island, a Ship put in from _Jamaica_ for Water, the Captain of which, one _Holford_, an old Buccaneer, happened to be _Vane_'s Acquaintance; he thought this a good Opportunity to get off, and accordingly applied to his old

He told him, _He might easily find a Way to get off, if he had a Mind to it: I am now going down the Bay_, says he, _and shall return hither, in about a Month; and if I find you upon the Island when I come back, I'll carry you to_ Jamaica, _and hang you.
Which Way can I get away_?
Answers _Vane.
Are there not Fishermen's Dories upon the Beach?
Can't you take one of them_?
Replies _Holford.
What_, says _Vane, would you have me steal a Dory then?
Do you make it a Matter of Conscience_?
Said _Holford, to steal a Dory, when you have been a common Robber and Pyrate, stealing Ships and Cargoes, and plundering all Mankind that fell in your Way?
Stay there, and be d--n'd, if you are so Squeamish_: And so left him.
After Captain _Holford_'s Departure, another Ship put in to the same Island in her Way home for Water; none of whose Company knowing _Vane_, he easily passed upon them for another Man, and so was shipp'd for the Voyage.
One would be apt to think that _Vane_ was now pretty safe, and likely to escape the Fate which his Crimes had merited; but here a cross Accident happen'd that ruin'd all: _Holford_, returning from the Bay, was met with by this Ship; the Captains being very
Why_, says he, _I have shipp'd a Man at such an Island, who was cast away in a trading Sloop, he seems to be a brisk Hand.

If it be him_, replies the other, _I won't keep him: Why then_, says _Holford, I'll send and take him aboard, and surrender him at_ Jamaica.
Which being agreed to, Captain _Holford_, as soon as he returned to his Ship, sent his Boat with his Mate armed, who coming to _Vane_, shewed him a Pistol, and told him, _He was his Prisoner_; which none opposing, he was brought aboard, and put in Irons;

OF Captain _John Rackam_, And his CREW.
THIS _John Rackam_, as has been mentioned in the last Chapter, was Quarter-Master to _Vane_'s Company, till they were divided, and _Vane_ turned out for refusing to board and fight the _French_ Man of War; then _Rackam_ was voted Captain of that Division
The 24th of _November_ 1718, was the first Day of his Command, and his first Cruize was among the _Caribbee Islands_, where he took and plunder'd several Vessels.
We have already taken Notice, that when Captain _Woodes Rogers_ went to the Island of _Providence_, with the King's Pardon to such as should surrender, this Brigantine, which _Rackam_ now commanded, made its Escape, thro' another Passage, bidding Defiance
To Windward of _Jamaica_, a _Madera_ Man fell into the Pyrates Way, which they detained two or three Days, till they had made their Market out of her, and then gave her back to the Master, and permitted one _Hosea Tisdell_, a Tavern-Keeper at _Jamaica_,
After this Cruize, they went into a small Island and cleaned, and spent their _Christmas_ ashore, drinking and carousing as long as they had any Liquor left, and then went to Sea again for more, where they succeeded but too well, though they took no
_Rackam_ stood off towards the Island of _Burmudas_, and took a Ship bound to _England_ from _Carolina_, and a small Pink from _New-England_, and brought them to the _Bahama_ Islands, where with the Pitch, Tar, and Stores, they clean'd again, and refitted
From hence they sailed to the Back of _Cuba_, where _Rackam_ kept a little kind of a Family, at which Place, they staid a considerable Time, living ashore with their Dalilahs, till their Money and Provision were expended, and then they concluded it Time to
The _Spanish_ Guardship attack'd the Pyrate, but _Rackam_ being close in behind a little Island, she could do but little Execution where she lay, therefore the _Spaniard_ warps into the Channel that Evening, in order to make sure of her the next Morning.
_Rackam_ finding his Case desperate, and hardly any Possibility of escaping, resolved to attempt the following Enterprize: The _Spanish_ Prize lying for better Security close into the Land, between the little Island and the Main; _Rackam_ takes his Crew
_Rackam_ and his Crew had no Occasion to be displeased at the Exchange, that enabled them to continue some Time longer in a Way of Life that suited their depraved Tempers: In _August_ 1720, we find him at Sea again, scouring the Harbours and Inlets of the
In the Beginning of _September_, they took seven or eight Fishing-Boats in _Harbour Island_, stole their Nets and other Tackle, and then went off the _French_ Part of _Hispaniola_, and landed, and took Cattle away, with two or three _French_ Men they found
They afterwards plundered two Sloops, and returned to _Jamaica_, on the North Coast of which Island, near _Porto Maria_ Bay, they took a Scooner, _Thomas Spenlow_ Master; it was then the 19th of _October_.
The next Day, _Rackam_ seeing a Sloop in _Dry Harbour_ Bay, he stood in and fired a Gun; the Men all run ashore, and he took the Sloop and Lading, but when those ashore found them to be Pyrates, they hailed the Sloop, and let them know they were all
_Rackam_'s coasting the Island in this Manner, proved fatal to him, for Intelligence came to the Governor, of his Expedition, by a Canoa which he had surprized ashore, in _Ocho_ Bay; upon which a Sloop was immediately fitted out, and sent round the Island
_Rackam_ rounding the Island, and drawing near the Westermost Point, called Point _Negril_, saw a small Pettiauger, which at sight of the Sloop, run ashore and landed her Men; when one of them hailed her, Answer was made, _They were_ English _Men_, and
The Pyrates finding she stood directly towards her, fear'd the Event, and weighed their Anchor, which they but lately let go, and stood off: Captain _Barnet_ gave them Chace, and having the Advantage of little Breezes of Wind, which blew off the Land, came
In about a Fortnight after the Prisoners were brought ashore, _viz.
November_ 16, 1720, a Court of Admiralty was held at St. _Jago de la Vega_, before which the following Persons were convicted, and Sentence of Death passed upon them, by the President, Sir _Nicholas Laws, viz.
John Rackam_ Captain, _George Fetherston_ Master, _Richard Corner_ Quarter-Master, _John Davis, John Howell, Patrick Carty, Thomas Earl, James Dobbin_ and _Noah Harwood_.
The five first were executed the next Day at _Gallows Point_, at the Town of _Port Royal_, and the rest, the Day after, at _Kingston_; _Rackam, Feverston_ and _Corner_, were afterwards taken down and hang'd up in Chains, one at _Plumb Point_, one at _Bush
But what was very surprizing, was, the Conviction of the nine Men that came aboard the Sloop the same Day she was taken.
They were try'd at an Adjournment of the Court, on the 24th of _January_, waiting all that Time, it is supposed, for Evidence, to prove the pyratical Intention of going aboard the said Sloop; for it seems there was no Act of Pyracy committed by them, after

That during the Time Captain _Barnet_ chased them, some of the Prisoners at the Bar (but which of them he could not tell) helped to row the Sloop, in order to escape from _Barnet_: That they all seemed to be consorted together.
This was the Substance of all that was evidenced against them, the Prisoners answered in their Defence, `That they had no Witnesses: That they had bought a Pettiauger in order to go a Turtleing; and being at _Negril Point_, and just got ashore, they saw a

_The_ LIFE _of_ MARY READ, NOW we are to begin a History full of surprizing Turns and Adventures; I mean, that of _Mary Read_ and _Anne Bonny_, alias _Bonn_, which were the true Names of these two Pyrates; the odd Incidents of their rambling Lives are
_Mary Read_ was born in _England_, her Mother was married young, to a Man who used the Sea, who going a Voyage soon after their Marriage, left her with Child, which Child proved to be a Boy.
As to the Husband, whether he was cast away, or died in the Voyage, _Mary Read_ could not tell; but however, he never returned more; nevertheless, the Mother, who was young and airy, met with an Accident, which has often happened to Women who are young,
Finding her Burthen grow, in order to conceal her Shame, she takes a formal Leave of her Husband's Relations, giving out, that she went to live with some Friends of her own, in the Country: Accordingly she went away, and carried with her her young Son, at
Here the Mother liv'd three or four Years, till what Money she had was almost gone; then she thought of returning to _London_, and considering that her Husband's Mother was in some Circumstances, she did not doubt but to prevail upon her, to provide for
Thus the Mother gained her Point, she bred up her Daughter as a Boy, and when she grew up to some Sense, she thought proper to let her into the Secret of her Birth, to induce her to conceal her Sex.
It happen'd that the Grandmother died, by which Means the Subsistance that came from that Quarter, ceased, and they were more and more reduced in their Circumstances; wherefore she was obliged to put her Daughter out, to wait on a _French_ Lady, as a
He was much surprized at what he found out, and not a little pleased, taking it for granted, that he should have a Mistress solely to himself, which is an unusual Thing in a Camp, since there is scarce one of those Campaign Ladies, that is ever true to a
This was the utmost Wish of her Heart, in short, they exchanged Promises, and when the Campaign was over, and the Regiment marched into Winter Quarters, they bought Woman's Apparel for her, with such Money as they could make up betwixt them, and were
The Story of two Troopers marrying each other, made a great Noise, so that several Officers were drawn by Curiosity to assist at the Ceremony, and they agreed among themselves that every one of them should make a small Present to the Bride, towards
Thus being set up, they seemed to have a Desire of quitting the Service, and settling in the World; the Adventure of their Love and Marriage had gained them so much Favour, that they easily obtained their Discharge, and they immediately set up an Eating
But this Happiness lasted not long, for the Husband soon died, and the Peace of _Reswick_ being concluded, there was no Resort of Officers to _Breda_, as usual; so that the Widow having little or no Trade, was forced to give up House-keeping, and her
It happen'd this Ship was taken by _English_ Pyrates, and _Mary Read_ was the only _English_ Person on Board, they kept her amongst them, and having plundered the Ship, let it go again; after following this Trade for some Time, the King's Proclamation came
The Crew of _Mary Read_ took the Benefit of this Proclamation, and having surrender'd, liv'd quietly on Shore; but Money beginning to grow short, and hearing that Captain _Woods Rogers_, Governor of the Island of _Providence_, was fitting out some
These Privateers were no sooner sail'd out, but the Crews of some of them, who had been pardoned, rose against their Commanders, and turned themselves to their old Trade: In this Number was _Mary Read_.
It is true, she often declared, that the Life of a Pyrate was what she always abhor'd, and went into it only upon Compulsion, both this Time, and before, intending to quit it, whenever a fair Opportunity should offer it self; yet some of the Evidence
This was part of the Evidence against her, which she denied; which, whether true or no, thus much is certain, that she did not want Bravery, nor indeed was she less remarkable for her Modesty, according to her Notions of Virtue: Her Sex was not so much as
Captain _Rackam_, (as he was enjoined,) kept the Thing a Secret from all the Ship's Company, yet, notwithstanding all her Cunning and Reserve, Love found her out in this Disguise, and hinder'd her from forgetting her Sex.
In their Cruize they took a great Number of Ships belonging to _Jamaica_, and other Parts of the _West-Indies_, bound to and from _England_; and when ever they meet any good Artist, or other Person that might be of any great Use to their Company, if he was
Among these was a young Fellow of a most engageing Behaviour, or, at least, he was so in the Eyes of _Mary Read_, who became so smitten with his Person and Address, that she could neither rest, Night or Day; but as there is nothing more ingenious than
The young Fellow, who was made of Flesh and Blood, had his Curiosity and Desire so rais'd by this Sight, that he never ceased importuning her, till she confessed what she was.
Now begins the Scene of Love; as he had a Liking and Esteem for her, under her supposed Character, it was now turn'd into Fondness and Desire; her Passion was no less violent than his, and perhaps she express'd it, by one of the most generous Actions that
It happened this young Fellow had a Quarrel with one of the Pyrates, and their Ship then lying at an Anchor, near one of the Islands, they had appointed to go ashore and fight, according to the Custom of the Pyrates: _Mary Read_, was to the last Degree
It is true, she had fought before, when she had been insulted by some of those Fellows, but now it was altogether in her Lover's Cause, she stood as it were betwixt him and Death, as if she could not live without him.
If he had no regard for her before, this Action would have bound him to her for ever; but there was no Occasion for Ties or Obligations, his Inclination towards her was sufficient; in fine, they applied their Troth to each other, which _Mary Read_ said,
She declared she had never committed Adultery or Fornication with any Man, she commended the Justice of the Court, before which she was tried, for distinguishing the Nature of their Crimes; her Husband, as she call'd him, with several others, being
she would not tell, but, said he was an honest Man, and had no Inclination to such Practices, and that they had both resolved to leave the Pyrates the first Opportunity, and apply themselves to some honest Livelyhood.
It is no doubt, but many had Compassion for her, yet the Court could not avoid finding her Guilty; for among other Things, one of the Evidences against her, deposed, that being taken by _Rackam_, and detain'd some Time on Board, he fell accidentally into
--She answer'd, that as to hanging, she thought it no great Hardship, for, were it not for that, every cowardly Fellow would turn Pyrate, and so infest the Seas, that Men of Courage must starve:-- That if it was put to the Choice of the Pyrates, they would
Being found quick with Child, as has been observed, her Execution was respited, and it is possible she would have found Favour, but she was seiz'd with a violent Fever, soon after her Tryal, of which she died in Prison.
_The_ LIFE _of_ ANNE BONNY.
AS we have been more particular in the Lives of these two Women, than those of other Pyrates, it is incumbent on us, as a faithful Historian, to begin with their Birth.
_Anne Bonny_ was born at a Town near _Cork_, in the Kingdom of _Ireland_, her Father an Attorney at Law, but _Anne_ was not one of his legitimate Issue, which seems to cross an old Proverb, which says, _that Bastards have the best Luck_.
Her Father was a Married Man, and his Wife having been brought to Bed, contracted an Illness in her lying in, and in order to recover her Health, she was advised to remove for Change of Air; the Place she chose, was a few Miles distance from her Dwelling,
Here she sojourn'd some Time, her Husband staying at Home, to follow his Affairs.
The Servant-Maid, whom she left to look after the House, and attend the Family, being a handsome young Woman, was courted by a young Man of the same Town, who was a _Tanner_; this _Tanner_ used to take his Opportunities, when the Family was out of the Way,
The Maid soon miss'd the Spoons, and knowing that no Body had been in the Room, but herself and the young Man, since she saw them last, she charged him with taking them; he very stifly denied it, upon which she grew outragious, and threatned to go to a
As soon as she miss'd him, she gave over her Search, concluding he had carried them off, and went directly to the Constable, in order to have him apprehended: The young Man was informed, that a Constable had been in Search of him, but he regarded it but
Three or four Days passed, and still he was told, the Constable was upon the Hunt for him, this made him lye concealed, he could not comprehend the Meaning of it, he imagined no less, than that the Maid had a Mind to convert the Spoons to her own Use, and
It happened, at this Time, that the Mistress being perfectly recovered of her late Indisposition, was return'd Home, in Company with her Mother-in-Law; the first News she heard, was of the Loss of the Spoons, with the Manner how; the Maid telling her, at
The young Fellow had Intelligence of the Mistress's Arrival, and considering with himself, that he could never appear again in his Business, unless this Matter was got over, and she being a good natured Woman, he took a Resolution of going directly to her,
The Mistress could scarce believe it, however, she went directly to the Maid's Room, and turning down the Bed Cloaths, there, to her great Surprize, found the three Spoons; upon this she desired the young Man to go Home and mind his Business, for he should
The Mistress could not imagine the Meaning of this, she never had found the Maid guilty of any pilfering, and therefore it could not enter her Head, that she designed to steal the Spoons her self; upon the whole, she concluded the Maid had not been in her
She call'd to Mind several Actions of Kindness, her Husband had shewed the Maid, Things that pass'd unheeded by, when they happened, but now she had got that Tormentor, Jealousy, in her Head, amounted to Proofs of their Intimacy; another Circumstance which
As Women seldom forgive Injuries of this Kind, she thought of discharging her Revenge upon the Maid: In order to this, she leaves the Spoons where she found them, and orders the Maid to put clean Sheets upon the Bed, telling her, she intended to lye there
The Mistress, that every Thing might look to be done without Design, lies that Night in the Maid's Bed, little dreaming of what an Adventure it would produce: After she had been a Bed some Time, thinking on what had pass'd, for Jealousy kept her awake, she
She knew it to be her Husband's Voice; then her Fright was over, yet she made no Answer, least he should find her out, if she spoke, therefore she resolved to counterfeit Sleep, and take what followed.
The Husband came to Bed, and that Night play'd the vigorous Lover; but one Thing spoil'd the Diversion on the Wife's Side, which was, the Reflection that it was not design'd for her; however she was very passive, and bore it like a Christian.
Early before Day, she stole out of Bed, leaving him asleep, and went to her Mother in Law, telling her what had passed, not forgetting how he had used her, as taking her for the Maid; the Husband also stole out, not thinking it convenient to be catch'd in
The Husband loiter'd about till twelve a Clock at Noon, then comes Home, pretended he was just come to Town; as soon as he heard what had passed, in Relation to the Maid, he fell into a great Passion with his Wife; this set the Thing into a greater Flame,
The Maid lay a long Time in the Prison, it being near half a Year to the Assizes; but before it happened, it was discovered she was with Child; when she was arraign'd at the Bar, she was discharged for want of Evidence; the Wife's Conscience touch'd her,
But what alarm'd the Husband most, was, that it was discovered the Wife was with Child also, he taking it for granted, he had had no Intimacy with her, since her last lying in, grew jealous of her, in his Turn, and made this a Handle to justify himself,
The Mother fell ill, sent to her Son to reconcile him to his Wife, but he would not hearken to it; therefore she made a Will, leaving all she had in the Hands of certain Trustees, for the Use of the Wife and two Children lately born, and died a few Days
This was an ugly Turn upon him, his greatest Dependence being upon his Mother; however, his Wife was kinder to him than he deserved, for she made him a yearly Allowance out of what was left, tho' they continued to live separate: It lasted near five Years;
The Wife heard he had a little Boy at Home he was very fond of, but as she did not know any Relation of his that had such a Child, she employ'd a Friend to enquire further into it; this Person by talking with the Child, found it to be a Girl, discovered
Upon this Intelligence, the Wife being unwilling that her Children's Money should go towards the Maintenance of Bastards, stopped the Allowance: The Husband enraged, in a kind of Revenge, takes the Maid home, and lives with her publickly, to the great
At first he followed the Practice of the Law in that Province, but afterwards fell into Merchandize, which proved more successful to him, for he gained by it sufficient to purchase a considerable Plantation: His Maid, who passed for his Wife, happened to
She was of a fierce and couragious Temper, wherefore, when she lay under Condemnation, several Stories were reported of her, much to her Disadvantage, as that she had kill'd an _English_ Servant-Maid once in her Passion with a Case-Knife, while she look'd
While she lived with her Father, she was look'd upon as one that would be a good Fortune, wherefore it was thought her Father expected a good Match for her; but she spoilt all, for without his Consent, she marries a young Fellow, who belonged to the Sea,
Here she became acquainted with _Rackam_ the Pyrate, who making Courtship to her, soon found Means of withdrawing her Affections from her Husband, so that she consented to elope from him, and go to Sea with _Rackam_ in Men's Cloaths: She was as good as her
The King's Proclamation being out, for pardoning of Pyrates, he took the Benefit of it, and surrendered; afterwards being sent upon the privateering Account, he returned to his old Trade, as has been already hinted in the Story of _Mary Read_.
In all these Expeditions, _Anne Bonny_ bore him Company, and when any Business was to be done in their Way, no Body was more forward or couragious than she, and particularly when they were taken; she and _Mary Read_, with one more, were all the Persons
Her Father was known to a great many Gentlemen, Planters of _Jamaica_, who had dealt with him, and among whom he had a good Reputation; and some of them, who had been in _Carolina_, remember'd to have seen her in his House; wherefore they were inclined to
The Day that _Rackam_ was executed, by special Favour, he was admitted to see her; but all the Comfort she gave him, was, _that she was sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a Man, he need not have been hang'd like a Dog_.
She was continued in Prison, to the Time of her lying in, and afterwards reprieved from Time to Time; but what is become of her since, we cannot tell; only this we know, that she was not executed.

VIII.
OF Captain _Howel Davis_, And his CREW.
CAptain _Howel Davis_ was born at _Milford_, in _Monmouthshire_, and was from a Boy brought up to the Sea.
The last Voyage he made from _England_, was in the _Cadogan_ Snow of _Bristol_, Captain _Skinner_ Commander, bound for the Coast of _Guiney_, of which Snow _Davis_ was chief Mate: They were no sooner arrived at _Sierraleon_ on the aforesaid Coast, but they
After the Death of Captain _Skinner, Davis_ pretended that he was mightily sollicited by _England_ to engage with him; but that he resolutely answered, he would sooner be shot to Death than sign the Pyrates Articles.
Upon which, _England_, pleased with his Bravery, sent him and the rest of the Men again on Board the Snow, appointing him Captain of her, in the Room of _Skinner_, commanding him to pursue his Voyage.
He also gave him a written Paper sealed up, with Orders to open it when he should come into a certain Latitude, and at the Peril of his Life follow the Orders therein set down.
This was an Air of Grandeur like what Princes practice to their Admirals and Generals.
--It was punctually complied with by _Davis_, who read it to the Ship's Company; it contained no less than a generous Deed of Gift of the Ship and Cargoe, to _Davis_ and the Crew, ordering him to go to _Brasil_ and dispose of the Lading to the best
_Davis_ proposed to the Crew, whether they were willing to follow their Directions, but to his great Surprize, found the Majority of them altogether averse to it, wherefore in a Rage, he bad them be damn'd, and go where they would.
They knew that Part of their Cargoe was consigned to certain Merchants at _Barbadoes_, wherefore they steered for that Island.
When they arrived, they related to these Merchants the unfortunate Death of _Skinner_, and the Proposal which had been made to them by _Davis_; upon which _Davis_ was seized and committed to Prison, where he was kept three Months; however, as he had been
However, _Davis_ was not long out of Business, for Captain _Rogers_ having fitted out two Sloops for Trade, one called the _Buck_, the other the _Mumvil Trader; Davis_ found an Employment on Board of one of them; the Lading of these Sloops was of
The first Place they touched at, was the Island of _Martinico_, belonging to the _French_, where _Davis_ having conspired with some others, rise in the Night, secured the Master and seized the Sloop; as soon as this was done, they called to the other
After this, a Counsel of War was called over a large Bowl of Punch, at which it was proposed to chuse a Commander; the Election was soon over, for it fell upon _Davis_ by a great Majority of _legal Pollers_, there was no Scrutiny demanded, for all
After this they consulted about a proper Place where they might clean their Sloop, a light Pair of Heels being of great Use either to take, or escape being taken; for this purpose they made Choice of _Coxon_'s _Hole_, at the East End of the Island of
Here they cleaned with much Difficulty, for they had no Carpenter in their Company, a Person of great Use upon such Exigencies; from hence they put to Sea, making to the North-Side of the Island of _Hispaniola_.
The first Sail which fell in their Way, was a _French_ Ship of twelve Guns; it must be observed, that _Davis_ had but thirty five Hands, yet Provisions began to grow short with him; wherefore he attacked this Ship, she soon struck, and he sent twelve of
_Davis_ then proposed to his Men to attack her, telling them, she would be a rare Ship for their Use, but they looked upon it to be an extravagant Attempt, and discovered no Fondness for it, but he assured them he had a Stratagem in his Head would make all
The Prize being a slow Sailor, _Davis_ first came up with the Enemy, and standing along Side of them, shewed his pyratical Colours: They, much surpriz'd, called to _Davis_, telling him, they wondered at his Impudence in venturing to come so near them, and
In the mean Time the Prize drew near, who obliged all the Prisoners to come upon Deck in white Shirts, to make a Shew of Force, as they had been directed by _Davis_; they also hoisted a dirty Tarpawlin, by Way of black Flag, they having no other, and fir'd
_Davis_ called out to the Captain to come on Board of him, with twenty of his Hands; he did so, and they were all for the greater Security clapt into Irons, the Captain excepted: Then he sent four of his own Men on Board the first Prize, and in order still
Here he ordered them to nail up the Guns in the little Prize, to take out all the small Arms and Powder, and to go every Man of them on Board the second Prize; when this was done, he ordered that more of the Prisoners should be removed out of the great
Thus the three Ships kept Company for 2 Days, when finding the great Prize to be a very dull Sailor, he thought she would not be fit for his Purpose, wherefore he resolved to restore her to the Captain, with all his Hands; but first, he took Care to take
The _French_ Captain was in such a Rage, at being so outwitted, that when he got on Board his own Ship, he was going to throw himself over-board, but was prevented by his Men.
Having let go both his Prizes, he steered Northward, in which Course he took a small _Spanish_ Sloop; after this, he made towards the _Western_ Islands, but met with no Booty thereabouts; then he steered for the _Cape de Verde_ Islands, they cast Anchor at
Here he remained five Weeks, in which Time, he and half his Crew, for their Pleasure, took a Journey to the chief Town of the Island, which was 19 Miles up the Country: _Davis_ making a good Appearance, was caressed by the Governor and the Inhabitants, and
At their Return they clean'd their Ship, and put to Sea, but not with their whole Company; for five of them, like _Hannibal_'s Men, were so charm'd with the Luxuries of the Place, and the free Conversation of some Women, that they staid behind; and one of
From hence they sailed to _Bonevista_, and looked into that Harbour, but finding nothing, they steer'd for the Isle of _May_: When they arrived here, they met with a great many Ships and Vessels in the Road, all which they plundered, taking out of them
One of the Ships they took to their own Use, mounted her with twenty six Guns, and call'd her the _King James_.
There being no fresh Water hereabouts, they made towards St. _Jago_, belonging to the _Portuguese_, in order to lay in a Store; _Davis_, with a few Hands, going ashore to find the most commodious Place to water at, the Governor, with some Attendants, came
And not liking _Davis_'s Account of himself, the Governor was so plain to tell them, he suspected them to be Pyrates.
_Davis_ seemed mightily affronted, standing much upon his Honour, replying to the Governor, he scorn'd his Words; however, as soon as his Back was turn'd, for fear of Accidents, he got on Board again as fast as he could.
_Davis_ related what had happened, and his Men seemed to resent the Affront which had been offered him.
_Davis_, upon this, told them, he was confident he could surprize the Fort in the Night; they agreed with him to attempt it, and accordingly, when it grew late, they went ashore well arm'd; and the Guard which was kept, was so negligent, that they got
Those in the Fort, in their Hurry, run into the Governor's House to save themselves, which they barricadoed so strongly, that _Davis_'s Party could not enter it; however, they threw in Granadoe-Shells, which not only ruin'd all the Furniture, but kill'd
When it was Day the whole Country was alarm'd, and came to attack the Pyrates; wherefore it not being their Business to stand a Siege, they made the best of their Way on Board their Ship again, after having dismounted the Guns of the Fort.
By this Enterprize they did a great Deal of Mischief to the _Portuguese_, and but very little Good to themselves.
Having put to Sea they muster'd their Hands, and found themselves near seventy strong; then it was proposed what Course they should steer, and differing in their Opinions, they divided, and by a Majority it was carried for _Gambia_ on the Coast of
They ask'd him how it was possible, since it was garrisoned?
He desired they would leave the Management of it to him, and he would undertake to make them Masters of it.
They began now to conceive so high an Opinion of his Conduct, as well as Courage, that they thought nothing impossible to him, therefore they agreed to obey him, without enquiring further into his Design.
Having come within Sight of the Place, he ordered all his Men under Deck, except as many as were absolutely necessary for working the Ship, that those from the Fort seeing a Ship with so few Hands, might have no Suspicion of her being any other than a
In rowing ashore he gave his Men Instructions what to say in Case any Questions should be asked them.
Being come to the landing Place, he was received by a File of Musqueteers, and conducted into the Fort, where the Governor accosting them civilly, ask'd them who they were, and whence they came?
They answered they were of _Liverpool_, bound for the River of _Sinnegal_, to trade for Gum and Elephants Teeth, but that they were chaced on that Coast by two _French_ Men of War, and narrowly escaped being taken, having a little the Heels of them; but
They answered, Iron and Plate, which were good Things there; the Governor told them he would Slave them to the full Value of their Cargoe, and asked them, if they had any _European_ Liquor on Board?
they answered, a little for their own Use; however, a Hamper should be at his Service.
The Governor then very civilly invited them all to stay and dine with him; _Davis_ told him, that being Commander of the Ship, he must go on Board to see her well moored, and give some other Orders, but those two Gentlemen might stay, and that he himself
While he was in the Fort, his Eyes were very busy in observing how Things lay; he took Notice there was a Centry at the Entrance, and a Guard-House just by it, where the Soldiers upon Duty commonly waited, their Arms standing in a Corner, in a Heap; he saw
These Precautions being taken, he ordered his Men, who were to go in the Boat with him, to put two Pair of Pistols each under their Cloaths, he doing the like himself, and gave them Directions to go into the Guard-Room, and to enter into Conversation with
When _Davis_ arrived, Dinner not being ready, the Governor proposed that they should pass their Time in making a Bowl of Punch till Dinner-Time: It must be observed, that _Davis_'s Coxen waited upon them, who had an Opportunity of going about all Parts of
The Governor being no Ways prepared for such an Attack, promised to be very Passive, and do all they desired, therefore they shut the Door, took down all the Arms that hung in the Hall, and loaded them.
_Davis_ fires his Pistol thro' the Window, upon which his Men, without, executed their Part of the Scheme, like Heroes, in an Instant; getting betwixt the Soldiers and their Arms, all with their Pistols cock'd in their Hands, while one of them carried the
When this was done, they locked the Soldiers into the Guard-Room, and kept Guard without.
In the mean Time one of them struck the Union Flag on the Top of the Castle, at which Signal those on Board sent on Shore a Reinforcement of Hands, and they got Possession of the Fort without the least Hurry or Confusion, or so much as a Man lost of either
_Davis_ harangued the Soldiers, upon which a great many of them took on with him, those who refused, he sent on Board the little Sloop, and because he would not be at the Trouble of a Guard for them, he ordered all the Sails and Cables out of her, which
This Day was spent in a kind of Rejoycing, the Castle firing her Guns to salute the Ship, and the Ship the Castle; but the next Day they minded their Business, that is, they fell to plundering, but they found Things fall vastly short of their Expectation;
After they had done as much Mischief as they could, and were weighing Anchor to be gone, they spy'd a Ship bearing down upon them in full Sail; they soon got their Anchor's up, and were in a Readiness to receive her.
This Ship prov'd to be a _French_ Pyrate of fourteen Guns and sixty four Hands, half _French_, half Negroes; the Captain's Name was _La Bouse_; he expected no less than a rich Prize, which made him so eager in the Chace; but when he came near enough to see
As he was making towards her, for this Purpose, he fired a Gun, and hoisted his black Colours; _Davis_ returned the Salute, and hoisted his black Colours also.
The _French_ Man was not a little pleased at this happy Mistake; they both hoisted out their Boats, and the Captains went to meet and congratulate one another with a Flag of Truce in their Sterns; a great many Civilities passed between them, and _La Bouse_
The first Place they touch'd at, was _Sierraleon_, where at first going in, they spied a tall Ship at Anchor; _Davis_ being the best Sailor first came up with her, and wondering that she did not try to make off, suspected her to be a Ship of Force.
As soon as he came along Side of her, she brought a Spring upon her Cable, and fired a whole Broadside upon _Davis_, at the same Time hoisted a black Flag; _Davis_ hoisted his black Flag in like Manner, and fired one Gun to Leeward.
In fine, she proved to be a Pyrate Ship of twenty four Guns, commanded by one _Cocklyn_, who expecting these two would prove Prizes, let them come in, least his getting under Sail might frighten them away.
This Satisfaction was great on all Sides, at this Junction of Confederates and Brethren in Iniquity; two Days they spent in improving their Acquaintance and Friendship, the third Day _Davis_ and _Cocklyn_, agreed to go in _La Bouse_'s Brigantine and attack
They took Possession of it, and continued there near seven Weeks, in which Time they all cleaned their Ships.
We should have observed, that a Galley came into the Road while they were there, which _Davis_ insisted should be yielded to _La Bouse_, according to his Word of Honour before given; _Cocklyn_ did not oppose it, so _La Bouse_ went into her, with his Crew,
Having called a Counsel of War, they agreed to sail down the Coast together, and for the greater Grandeur, appointed a Commadore, which was _Davis_; but they had not kept Company long, when drinking together on Board of _Davis_, they had like to have
--Upon which the other two went on Board their respective Ships, and immediately parted, each steering a different Course.
_Davis_ held on his Way down the Coast, and making Cape _Appollonia_, he met with two _Scotch_ and one _English_ Vessel, which he plundered, and then let go.
About five Days after he fell in with a _Dutch_ Interloper of thirty Guns and ninety Men, (half being _English_,) off Cape _Three Points_ Bay; _Davis_ coming up along Side of her, the _Dutch_ Man gave the first Fire, and pouring in a broad-Side upon
_Davis_ fitted up the _Dutch_ Ship for his own Use, and called her the _Rover_, aboard of which he mounted thirty two Guns, and twenty seven Swivels, and proceeded with her and the _King James_, to _Anamaboe_; he entered the Bay betwixt the Hours of twelve
_ the _Morrice_ Sloop, to the _Dutch_ Men, on Board of which alone were found a hundred and forty Negroes, besides dry Goods, and a considerable Quantity of Gold-Dust.
It happened there were several Canoes along Side of this last, when _Davis_ came in, who saved themselves and got ashore; these gave Notice at the Fort, that these Ships were Pyrates, upon which the Fort fired upon them, but without any Execution, for
The same Day he sail'd with his three Ships, making his Way down the Coast towards _Princes_, a _Portuguese_ Colony: But, before we proceed any farther in _Davis_'s Story, we shall give our Reader an Account of the _Portuguese_ Settlements on this Coast,

Before the Verticity and Use of the Compass, the _Portuguese_ Navigations had extended no farther than Cape _Non_, (it was their _ne plus ultra_,) and therefore so called; distress of Weather, indeed, had drove some Coasters to _Porto Santo_, and _Madera_,
Kings of _Portugal_, in Part of the 14th and in the 15th Century.
King _Alphonsus_ was not so much at leasure as his Predecessor, to pursue these Discoveries, but having seen the Advantages accrued to _Portugal_ by them, and that the Pope had confirmed the perpetual Donation of all they should discover between Cape

The Town is of mean Building, but large and populous, the Residence of the greater Part of the Natives, who, thro' the whole Island, are computed at 10000, the Militia at 3000, and are in general, a rascally thievish Generation, as an old grave Friend of
Most of the Ships from _Guiney_, of their own Nation, and frequently those of ours, call at one or other of these Islands, to recruit with fresh Provisions, and take in Water, which on the Coast are not so good, nor so conveniently to come by: Their own

The Island is reckoned nigh a Square, each Side 18 Leagues long, hilly, and lays under the _Æquinoctial_, a wooden Bridge just without the Town, being said not to deviate the least Part of a Minute, either to the Southward or Northward; and
Isle _Del Principe_, the next in Magnitude, a pleasant and delightful Spot to the grave, and thoughtfull Disposition of the _Portuguese_, an Improvement of Country Retirement, in that, this may be a happy and uninterrupted Retreat from the whole World.
I shall divide what I have to say on this Island, into Observations made on our Approach to it, on the Seas round it, the Harbour, Produce of the Island and Seasons, Way of Living among the Inhabitants, some Custom of the Negroes, with such proper
We were bound hither from _Whydah_, at the latter Part of the Month _July_, when the Rains are over, and the Winds hang altogether S. W. (as they do before the Rains, S. E.) yet with this Wind (when at Sea) we found the Ship gained unexpectedly so far to
e.
_ Windward,) that we could with ease have weathered any of the Islands, and this seems next to impossible should be, if the Currents, which were strong to Leeward, in the Road of _Whydah_, had extended in like Manner cross the Bite of _Benin_: No, it must
The Southern Coast of _Africa_ runs in a Line of Latitude, the Northern on an Eastern Line, but both strait, with the fewest Inlets, Gulphs or Bays, of either of the four Continents; the only large and remarkable one, is that of _Benin_ and _Calabar_,
For Proof of this, I shall lay down the following Observations as certain Facts.
That in the Rivers of _Gambia_ and _Sierraleon_, in the Straits and Channels of _Benin_, and in general along the whole Coast, the Flowings are regular on the Shores, with this Difference; that, in the abovemention'd Rivers, and in the Channels of _Benin_,
What I would deduce from this, besides a Confirmation of that ingenious Theory of the Tides, by Captain _Halley_; is first, that the Ships bound to _Angola, Cabenda_, and other Places on the Southern Coast of _Africa_, should cross the _Æquinoctial_ from
Secondly, On the Northern Side of _Guiney_, if Ships are bound from the _Gold-Coast_ to _Sierraleon, Gambia_, or elsewhere to Windward, considering the Weakness of these Currents, and the Favourableness of Land Breezes, and Southerly in the Rains,
Lastly, it is, in a great Measure, owning to this want of Inlets, and the Rivers being small and unnavigable, that the Seas rebound with so dangerous a Surff thro' the whole Continent.
Round the Shores of this Island, and at this Season, _(July, August_ and _September_,) there is a great Resort of Whale-Fish, tame, and sporting very nigh the Ships as they sail in, always in Pairs, the Female much the smaller, and often seen to turn on
The Number of Whales here has put me sometimes on thinking an advantageous Fishery might be made of it, but I presume they (no more than those of _Brasil)_ are the Sort which yield the profitable Part, called Whale-Bone: All therefore that the Islanders
The Rocks and outer Lines of the Island, are the Haunts of variety of Sea-Birds, especially Boobies and Noddies; the former are of the Bigness of a Gull, and a dark Colour, named so from their Simplicity, because they often sit still and let the Sailors
The Noddies are smaller and flat footed also.
What I would remark more of them, is, the admirable Instinct in these Birds, for the proper Seasons, and the proper Places for Support.
In the aforemention'd Months, when the large Fish were here, numerous Flocks of Fowl attend for the Spawn and Superfluity of their Nourishment; and in _January_ few of either; for the same Reason, there are scarce any Sea Fowl seen on the _African_ Coast;
The Harbour of _Princes_ is at the E. S. E. Point of the Island; the North-Side has gradual Soundings, but here deep Water, having no Ground at a Mile off with 140 Fathom of Line.
The Port (when in) is a smooth narrow Bay, safe from Winds, (unless a little Swell when Southerly) and draughted into other smaller and sandy Ones, convenient for raising of Tents, Watering, and hawling the Seam; the whole protected by a Fort, or rather
At the Head of the Bay stands the Town, about a Mile from the anchoring Place, and consists of two or three regular Streets, of wooden built Houses, where the Governor and chief Men of the Island reside.
Here the Water grows shallow for a considerable Distance, and the Natives, at every Ebb, (having before encompassed every convenient Angle with a Rise of Stones, something like Weirs in _England_) resort for catching of Fish, which, with them, is a daily
The Tides rise regularly 6 Foot in the Harbour, and yet not half that Heighth without the Capes that make the Bay.
Here are constantly two Missionaries, who are sent for six Years to inculcate the Christian Principles, and more especially attend the Conversion of the Negroes; the present are _Venetians_, ingenious Men, who seem to despise the loose Morals and Behaviour
They have a neat Conventual-House and a Garden appropriated, which, by their own Industry and Labour, not only thrives with the several Natives of the Soil, but many Exoticks and Curiosities.
A Fruit in particular, larger than a Chesnut, yellow, containing two Stones, with a Pulp, or clammy Substance about them, which, when suck'd, exceeds in Sweetness, Sugar or Honey, and has this Property beyond them, of giving a sweet Taste to every Liquid
The only Plague infesting the Garden, is a Vermin called Land-Crabs, in vast Numbers, of a bright red Colour, (in other Respects like the Sea ones) which burrough in these sandy Soils like Rabbets, and are as shy.
The Island is a pleasant Intermixture of Hill and Valley; the Hills spread with Palms, Coco-Nuts, and Cotton-Trees, with Numbers of Monkeys and Parrots among them; the Valleys with fruitful Plantations of _Yamms, Kulalu, Papas_, Variety of Sallating,
I shall run a Description of the Vegetables, with their Properties, not only because they are the Produce of this Island, but most of them of _Africa_ in general.
The Palm-Trees are numerous on the Shores of _Africa_, and may be reckoned the first of their natural Curiosities, in that they afford them Meat, Drink and Cloathing; they grow very straight to 40 and 50 Foot high, and at the top (only) have 3 or 4 Circles
The Trunk is very rough with Knobs, either Excrescencies, or the Healings of those Branches that were lopped off to forward the Growth of the Tree, and make it answer better in its Fruit.
The Branches are strongly tied together with a _Cortex_, which may be unravelled to a considerable Length and Breadth; the inward _Lamella_ of this _Cortex_, I know are wove like a Cloath at _Benin_, and afterwards died and worn: Under the Branches, and
On the very Top of the Palm, grows a Cabbage, called so, I believe, from some resemblance its Tast is thought to have with ours, and is used like it; the Covering has a Down that makes the best of Tinder, and the Weavings of other Parts are drawn out into
_Coco-Nut-Trees_ are branch'd like, but not so tall as, _Palm_ Trees, the Nut like them, growing under the Branches, and close to the Trunk; the milky Liquor they contain, (to half a Pint or more,) is often drank to quench Thirst, but surfeiting, and this
_Cotton_ Trees also are the Growth of all Parts of _Africk_, as well as the Islands, of vast Bigness, yet not so incremental as the Shrubs or Bushes of five or six Foot high; these bear a Fruit (if it may be so called) about the Bigness of Pigeons Eggs,
_Yamms_ are a common Root, sweeter but not unlike Potato's: _Kulalu_, a Herb like Spinnage: _Papa_, a Fruit less than the smallest Pumkins; they are all three for boiling, and to be eat with Meat; the latter are improved by the _English_ into a Turnip or
_Guava's_, a Fruit as large as a Pipin, with Seeds and Stones in it, of an uncouth astringing Tast, tho' never so much be said in Commendation of it, at the _West-Indies_, it is common for _Cræolians_, (who has tasted both,) to give it a Preference to
_Plantanes_ and _Bonano's_ are Fruit of oblong Figure, that I think differ only _secundum Major & Minus_, if any, the latter are preferable, and by being less, are juicier; they are usually, when stripped of their Coat, eat at Meals instead of Bread: The
_Manyoco_.
A Root that shoots its Branches about the heighth of a Currant Bush; from this Root the Islanders make a Farine or Flower, which they sell at three Ryals a Roove, and drive a considerable Trade for it with the Ships that call in.
The manner of making it, is first to press the Juice from it, (which is poisonous) done here with Engines, and then the Negroe Women, upon a rough Stone, rub it into a granulated Flower, reserved in their Houses, either to boil, as we do our Wheat, and is
One thing worth taking Notice about _Manyoco_ in this Island, is, that the Woods abound with a wild poisonous and more mortiferous Sort, which sometimes Men, unskilled in the Preparation of it, feed on to their Destruction: This the Missionaries assured me
_Indian Corn_, is likewise as well as the _Farine de Manyoco_ and Rice, the common Victualling of our Slave Ships, and is afforded here at 1000 Heads for two Dollars.
This Corn grows eight or nine Foot high, on a hard Reed or Stick, shooting forth at every six Inches Heighth, some long Leaves; it has always an Ear, or rather Head, at top, of, perhaps, 400 Fold Increase; and often two, three, or more, Midway.
Here are some Tamarind Trees; another called _Cola_, whose Fruit, or Nut (about twice the Bigness of a Chestnut, and bitter) is chewed by the _Portugueze_, to give a sweet Gust to their Water which they drink; but above all, I was shewn the Bark of one
I had like to have forgot their Cinnamon Trees; there is only one Walk of them, and is the Entrance of the Governor's Villa; they thrive extreemly well, and the Bark not inferior to our Cinnamon from _India_; why they and other Spice, in a Soil so proper,
They have two Winters, or rather Springs, and two Summers: Their Winters, which are the rainy Seasons, come in _September_ and _February_, or _March_, and hold two Months, returning that Fatness and generative Power to the Earth, as makes it yield a double

Similar to these are rainy Seasons also over all the Coast of _Africa_: If there may be allowed any general Way of calculating their Time, they happen from the Course of the Sun, as it respects the _Æquinoctial_ only; for if these _Æquinoxes_ prove rainy
The Manner of living among the _Portugueze_ here is, with the utmost Frugality and Temperance, even to Penury and Starving; a familiar Instance of Proof is, in the Voracity of their Dogs, who finding such clean Cupboards at home, are wild in a manner with
The best of them (excepting the Governor now and then) neither pay nor receive any Visits of Escapade or Recreation; they meet and sit down at each others Doors in the Street every Evening, and as few of them, in so small an Island, can have their
The Negroes have yet no hard Duty with them, they are rather Happy in Slavery; for as their Food is chiefly Vegetables, that could no way else be expended, there is no Murmurs bred on that account; and as their Business is Domestick, either in the Services
The Negroes are, most of them, thro' the Care of their Patroons, Christians, at least nominal, but excepting to some few, they adhere still to many silly Pagan Customs in their Mournings and Rejoycings, and in some Measure, powerful Majority has introduced

And this foolish Mirth will continue three or four Days together at a House, and perhaps twelve or sixteen Hours at a time.
The _Portugueze_, tho' eminently abstemious and temperate in all other Things, are unbounded in their Lusts; and perhaps they substitute the former in room of a Surgeon, as a Counterpoison to the Mischiefs of a promiscuous Salacity: They have most of them
_Annobono_ is the last, and of the least Consequence of the three Islands; there are Plenty of Fruits and Provisions, exchanged to Ships for old Cloaths and Trifles of any Sort; they have a Governor nominated from St. _Thome_, and two or three Priests,
* * * To return to _Davis_, the next Day after he left _Anamaboe_, early in the Morning, the Man at the Mast-Head espied a Sail.
It must be observed, they keep a good Look-out; for, according to their Articles, he who first espies a Sail, if she proves a Prize, is entitled to the best Pair of Pistols on Board, over and above his Dividend, in which they take a singular Pride; and a
Immediately they gave Chace, and soon came up with her; the Ship proved to be a _Hollander_, and being betwixt _Davis_ and the Shore, she made all the Sail she could, intending to run aground; _Davis_ guessed her Design, and putting out all his small
It was granted, for according to _Davis_'s Articles, it was agreed, that Quarter should be given whenever it was called for, upon Pain of Death.
This Ship proved a very rich Prize, having the Governor of _Acra_ on Board, with all his Effects, going to _Holland_; there was in Money to the Value of 15000 _l.
_ Sterling, besides other valuable Merchandizes, all which they brought on Board of themselves.
Upon this new Success, they restored Captain _Hall_ and Captain _Plumb_, before-mentioned, their Ships again, but strengthened their Company with thirty five Hands, all white Men, taken out of these two and the _Morrice_ Sloop; they also restored the
Before they got to the Island of _Princes_, one of their Ships, _viz.
_ that call'd the _King James_, sprung a Leak; _Davis_ order'd all Hands out of her, on Board his own Ship, with every thing else of Use, and left her at an Anchor at _High Cameroon_.
As soon as he came in Sight of the Island, he hoisted _English_ Colours; the _Portuguese_ observing a large Ship sailing towards them, sent out a little Sloop to examine what she might be; this Sloop hailing of _Davis_, he told them he was an _English_ Man
He saluted the Fort, which they answered, and he came to an Anchor just under their Guns, and hoisted out the Pinnace, Man of War Fashion, ordering nine Hands and a Coxen in it, to row him ashore.
The _Portugueze_, to do him the greater Honour, sent down a File of Musqueteers to receive him, and conduct him to the Governor.
The Governor not in the least suspecting what he was, received him very civilly, promising to supply him with whatever the Island afforded; _Davis_ thanked him, telling him, the King of _England_ would pay for whatever he should take; so after several
It happened a _French_ Ship came in there to supply it self with some Necessaries, which _Davis_ took into his Head to plunder, but to give the Thing a Colour of Right, he persuaded the _Portugueze_, that she had been trading with the Pyrates, and that he
A few Days after, _Davis_, with about fourteen more, went privately ashore, and walk'd up the Country towards a Village, where the Governor and the other chief Men of the Island kept their Wives, in tending, as we may suppose, to supply their Husbands
Having cleaned his Ship, and put all Things in Order, his Thoughts now were turned upon the main Business, _viz.
_ the Plunder of the Island, and not knowing where the Treasure lay, a Stratagem came into his Head, to get it (as he thought) with little Trouble, he consulted his Men upon it, and they liked the Design: His Scheme was, to make a Present to the Governor,
_ Sterling.
But this Stratagem proved fatal to him, for a _Portugueze_ Negroe swam ashore in the Night, and discovered the whole Plot to the Governor, and also let him know, that it was _Davis_ who had made the Attempt upon their Wives.
However, the Governor dissembled, received the Pyrates Invitation civilly, and promised that he and the rest would go.
The next Day _Davis_ went on Shore himself, as if it were out of greater Respect to bring the Governor on Board: He was received with the usual Civility, and he, and other principal Pyrates, who, by the Way, had assumed the Title of Lords, and as such took

IX.
OF Captain _Bartho.
Roberts_, And his CREW.
B_Artholomew Roberts_ sailed in an honest Employ, from _London_ aboard of the _Princess_, Captain _Plumb_ Commander, of which Ship he was second Mate: He left _England, November_ 1719, and arrived at _Guiney_ about _February_ following, and being at
In the beginning he was very averse to this sort of Life, and would certainly have escaped from them, had a fair Opportunity presented it self; yet afterwards he changed his Principles, as many besides him have done upon another Element, and perhaps for
_ Preferment,--and what he did not like as a private Man he could reconcile to his Conscience as a Commander.
_Davis_ being cut off in the manner beforementioned, the Company found themselves under a Necessity of filling up his Post, for which there appear'd two or three Candidates among the select Part of them, that were distinguish'd by the Title of Lords, such
and on canvassing this Matter, how shatter'd and weak a Condition their Government must be without a Head, since _Davis_ had been remov'd, in the manner beforemention'd, my Lord _Dennis_ propos'd, its said, over a Bowl to this Purpose.
_That it was not of any great Signification who was dignify'd with Title; for really and in Truth, all good Governments had_ (_like theirs_) _the supream Power lodged with the Community, who might doubtless depute and revoke as suited Interest or Humour.
We are the Original of this Claim_ (says he) _and should a Captain be so sawcy as to exceed Prescription at any time_, why down with Him!
_it will be a Caution after he is dead to his Successors, of what fatal Consequence any sort of assuming may be.
However, it is my Advice, that, while we are sober, we pitch upon a Man of Courage, and skill'd in Navigation, one, who by his Council and Bravery seems best able to defend this Commonwealth, and ward us from the Dangers and Tempests of an instable
A Fellow!
I think, in all Respects, worthy your Esteem and Favour_.
This Speech was loudly applauded by all but Lord _Sympson_, who had secret Expectations himself, but on this Disappointment, grew sullen, and left them, swearing, _he did not care who they chose Captain, so it was not a Papist, for against them he had
_Roberts_ was accordingly elected, tho' he had not been above six Weeks among them, the Choice was confirm'd both by the Lords and Commoners, and he accepted of the Honour, saying, _That since he had dipp'd his Hands in muddy Water, and must be a Pyrate,

These Men were headed by one _Kennedy_, a bold daring Fellow, but very wicked and profligate; they march'd directly up under the Fire of their Ship Guns, and as soon as they were discover'd, the _Portugueze_ quitted their Post and fled to the Town, and the
But this was not look'd upon as a sufficient Satisfaction for the Injury they received, therefore most of the Company were for burning the Town, which _Roberts_ said he would yield to, if any Means could be proposed of doing it without their own

Now that we are upon this Coast, I think it will be the proper Place to present our Readers with a Description of this Country, and some ingenious Remarks of a Friend, how beneficial a Trade might be carried on here by our _West-India_ Merchants, at a
A DESCRIPTION OF _BRASIL_, &c.
B_RASIL_ (a Name signifying the holy Cross) was discovered for the King of _Portugal_, by _Alvarez Cabral, Ann.

_ 1501.
extending almost from the _Æquinoctial_ to 28° South.
The Air is temperate and cool, in comparison of the _West-Indies_, from stronger Breezes and an opener Country, which gives less Interruption to the Winds.
The northernmost Part of it stretching about 180 Leagues, (a fine fertile Country,) was taken from the _Portuguese_ by the _Dutch West-India_ Company, _Anno.
_ 1637 or thereabouts; but the Conquerors, as is natural where there is little or no Religion subsisting, made such heavy Exactions on the _Portuguese_, and extended such Cruelty to the Natives, that prepared them both easily to unite for a Revolt,
That the _Dutch_, on Relinquishing, should keep all the Places they had conquered in _India_ from _Portugal_.
That they should pay the States 800000 _l.
_ and permit them still the Liberty of Trade to _Africa_ and _Brasil_, on the same Custom and Duties with the King of _Portugal_'s Subjects.
But since that Time, new Stipulations and Treaties have been made; wherein the _Dutch_, who have been totally excluded the _Brasil_ Trade, have, in lieu thereof, a Composition of 10 _per Cent_.
for the Liberty of trading to _Africa_; and this is always left by every _Portuguese_ Ship (before she begins her Slaving) with the _Dutch_ General of the _Gold-Coast_, at _Des Minas_.
There are only three principal Towns of Trade on the _Brasil_ Coast, St. _Salvadore_, St. _Sebastian_, and _Pernambuca_.
St. _Salvadore_ in the _Bahia los todos Santos_, is an Archbishoprick and Seat of the Viceroy, the chief Port of Trade for Importation, where most of the Gold from the Mines is lodged, and whence the Fleets for _Europe_ generally depart.
The Seas about it abound with Whale-Fish, which in the Season they catch in great Numbers; the Flesh is salted up generally to be the Victualling of their Slave-Ships, and the Train reserved for Exportation, at 30 and 35 Millrays a Pipe.
_Rio Janeiro (_the Town St. _Sebastian)_ is the Southernmost of the _Portuguese_, the worst provided of Necessaries, but commodious for a Settlement, because nigh the Mine, and convenient to supervise the Slaves, who, as I have been told, do usually allow
The Gold from hence is esteemed the best, (for being of a copperish Colour,) and they have a Mint to run it into Coin, both here and at _Bahia_; the Moidors of either having the initial Letters of each Place upon them.
_Pernambuca_ (tho' mention'd last) is the second in Dignity, a large and populous Town, and has its rise from the Ruins of _Olinda_, (or the handsome,) a City of a far pleasanter Situation, six Miles up the River, but not so commodious for Traffick and
Just above the Town the River divides it self into two Branches, not running directly into the Sea, but to the Southward; and in the Nook of the Island made by that Division, stands the Governor's House, a square plain Building of Prince _Maurice_'s, with
The Avenues to it are every way pleasant, thro' Visto's of tall Coco-Nut Trees.
Over each Branch of the River is a Bridge; that leading to the Country is all of Timber, but the other to the Town (of twenty six or twenty eight Arches) is half of Stone, made by the _Dutch_, who in their Time had little Shops and gaming Houses on each
The Pavements also of the Town are in some Places of broad Tiles, the remaining Fragments of their Conquest.
The Town has the outer Branch of the River behind it, and the Harbour before it, jetting into which latter are close Keys for the weighing and receiving of Customage on Merchandize, and for the meeting and conferring of Merchants and Traders.
The Houses are strong built, but homely, letticed like those of _Lisbon_, for the Admission of Air, without Closets, and what is worse, Hearths; which makes their Cookery consist all in frying and stewing upon Stoves; and that they do till the Flesh become
The greatest Inconvenience of _Pernambuca_ is, that there is not one Publick-House in it; so that Strangers are obliged to hire any ordinary one they can get, at a Guinea a Month: And others who come to transact Affairs of Importance, must come
The Market is stocked well enough, Beef being at five Farthings _per l_.
a Sheep or Goat at nine Shillings, a Turkey four Shillings, and Fowls two Shillings, the largest I ever saw, and may be procured much Cheaper, by hiring a Man to fetch them out of the Country.
The dearest in its kind is Water, which being fetch'd in Vessels from _Olinda_, will not be put on Board in the Road under two Crusado's a Pipe.
The _Portuguese_ here are darker than those of _Europe_, not only from a warmer Climate, but their many Intermarriages with the Negroes, who are numerous there, and some of them of good Credit and Circumstances.
The Women (not unlike the Mulatto Generation every where else) are fond of Strangers; not only the Courtezans, whose Interest may be supposed to wind up their Affections, but also the marryed Women who think themselves obliged, when you favour them with
There are three Monasteries, and about six Churches, none of them Rich or Magnificent, unless one dedicated to St. _Antonio_, the Patron of their Kingdom, which shines all over with exquisite Pieces of Paint and Gold.
The Export of _Brasil_ (besides Gold) is chiefly Sugars and Tobacco; the latter are sent off in Rowls of a Quintal Weight, kept continually moistened with Mulossus, which, with the Soil it springs from, imparts a strong and peculiar Scent, more sensible in
per l_.
as the Tobacco does at about 6 Millraies a Rowl.
The finest of their Sugars sells at 8 _s.
per_ Roove, and a small ill tasted Rum drawn from the Dregs and Mulossus, at two Testunes a Gallon.
Besides these, they send off great Quantities of Brasil Wood, and Whale Oyl, some Gums and Parrots, the latter are different from the _African_ in Colour and Bigness, for as they are blue and larger, these are green and smaller; and the Females of them
In lieu of this Produce, the _Portugueze_, once every Year by their Fleet from _Lisbon_, import all manner of European Commodities; and whoever is unable or negligent of supplying himself at that Season, buys at a very advanced Rate, before the Return of

On their Side it is prohibited under Pain of Death, a Law less effectual to the Prevention of it than pecuniary Mulcts would be, because a Penalty so inadequate and disproportioned, is only _In terrorem_, and makes it merciful in the Governor, or his
On our Side it is Confiscation of what they can get, which considering, they have no Men of War to guard the Coast, need be very little, without supine Neglect and Carelessness.

By that time the Compliment is paid to the Governor, the News has spread all round the Town, and some Merchant addresses you, as a Stranger, to the Civility of his House, but privately desires to know what Negroes he can have, and what Price.
A Governor may possibly use an Instrument in sifting this, but the Appearance of the Gentleman, and the Circumstance of being so soon engaged after leaving the other, will go a great way in forming a Man's Judgment, and leaves him no room for the Suspicion
The Hazard is less at _Rio Janeiro_.
There has been another Method attempted, of settling a Correspondence with some _Portugueze_ Merchant or two, who, as they may be certain within a Fortnight of any Vessels arriving on their Coast with Slaves, might settle Signals for the debarquing them at
However, Stratagems laudable, and attended with Profit, at no other Hazard (as I can perceive) then loss of Time, are worth attempting; it is what is every Day practised with the _Spaniards_ from _Jamaica_.

The _Portuguese_ being surprized at these Threats, and the sudden flourish of Cutlashes from the Pyrates, submitted without a Word, and the Captain came on Board; _Roberts_ saluted him after a friendly manner, telling him, that they were Gentlemen of
Whereupon this _Portuguese_ Master pointed to one of 40 Guns, and 150 Men, a Ship of greater Force than the _Rover_, but this no Ways dismayed them, _they were_ Portuguese, they said, and so immediately steered away for him.
When they came within Hail, the Master whom they had Prisoner, was ordered to ask, _how Seignior Capitain did_?
And to invite him on Board, _for that he had a Matter of Consequence to impart to him_, which being done, he returned for Answer, _That he would wait upon him presently_: But by the Bustle that immediately followed, the Pyrates perceived, they were
By this Time the Fleet was alarmed, Signals of Top-gallant Sheets flying, and Guns fired, to give Notice to the Men of War, who rid still at an Anchor, and made but scurvy hast out to their Assistance; and if what the Pyrates themselves related, be true,
They found this Ship exceeding rich, being laden chiefly with Sugar, Skins, and Tobacco, and in Gold 40000 Moidors, besides Chains and Trinckets, of considerable Value; particularly a Cross set with Diamonds, designed for the King of _Portugal_; which they

A Welcome Cargo!
They growing short in the Sea Store, and as _Sancho_ says, _No Adventures to be made without Belly-Timber_.
One Evening as they were rumaging (their Mine of Treasure) the _Portuguese_ Prize, this expected Vessel was descry'd at Mast-Head, and _Roberts_, imagining no Body could do the Business so well as himself, takes 40 Men in the Sloop, and goes in pursuit of
The Current still opposing their Endeavours, and perceiving no Hopes of beating up to their Ship, they came to an Anchor, and inconsiderately sent away the Boat to give the rest of the Company Notice of their Condition, and to order the Ship to them; but
Here like _Tantalus_, they almost famished in Sight of the fresh Streams and Lakes; being drove to such Extremity at last, that they were forc'd to tare up the Floor of the Cabin, and patch up a sort of Tub or Tray with Rope Yarns, to paddle ashore, and
After some Days, the long-wish'd-for Boat came back, but with the most unwellcome News in the World, for _Kennedy_, who was Lieutenant, and left in Absence of _Roberts_, to Command the Privateer and Prize, was gone off with both.
This was Mortification with a Vengeance, and you may imagine, they did not depart without some hard Speeches from those that were left, and had suffered by their Treachery: And that there need be no further mention of this _Kennedy_, I shall leave Captain
_Kennedy_ was now chosen Captain of the revolted Crew, but could not bring his Company to any determined Resolution; some of them were for pursuing the old Game, but the greater Part of them seem'd to have Inclinations to turn from those evil Courses, and
The first Thing they did, was to part with the great _Portugueze_ Prize, and having the Master of the Sloop (whose Name I think was _Cane_) aboard, who they said was a very honest Fellow, (for he had humoured them upon every Occasion,) told them of the
Captain _Kennedy_ in the _Rover_, sailed to _Barbadoes_, near which Island, they took a very peaceable Ship belonging to _Virginia_; the Commander was a Quaker, whose Name was _Knot_; he had neither Pistol, Sword, nor Cutlash on Board; and Mr. _Knot_
_ They also made Presents to the Sailors, some more, some less, and lived a jovial Life all the while they were upon their Voyage, Captain _Knot_ giving them their Way; nor indeed could he help himself, unless he had taken an Opportunity to surprize them,
In the mean Time Captain _Knot_ leaving four others on Board his Ship, (who intended to go to _North-Carolina_,) made what hast he could to discover to Mr. _Spotswood_ the Governor, what sort of Passengers he had been forced to bring with him, who by good
The latter had found Means to lodge Part of their Wealth with the Planters, who never brought it to Account: But Captain _Knot_ surrendered up every Thing that belonged to them, that were taken aboard, even what they presented to him, in lieu of such
Some Days after the taking of the _Virginia_ Man last mentioned, in cruising in the Latitude of _Jamaica, Kennedy_ took a Sloop bound thither from _Boston_, loaded with Bread and Flower; aboard of this Sloop went all the Hands who were for breaking the
Among the former were _Kennedy_, their Captain, of whose Honour they had such a dispicable Notion, that they were about to throw him over-board, when they found him in the Sloop, as fearing he might betray them all, at their return to _England_; he having
However, Captain _Kennedy_, by taking solemn Oaths of Fidelity to his Companions, was suffered to proceed with them.
In this Company there was but one that pretended to any skill in Navigation, (for _Kennedy_ could neither write nor read, he being preferred to the Command merely for his Courage, which indeed he had often signaliz'd, particularly in taking the
The whole Company refresh'd themselves at a little Village about five Miles from the Place where they left the Sloop, and passed there for Ship-wreck'd Sailors, and no doubt might have travelled on without Suspicion; but the mad and riotous Manner of their
_Kennedy_ and another left them here, and travelling to one of the Sea-Ports, ship'd themselves for _Ireland_, and arrived there in Safety.
Six or seven wisely withdrew from the rest, travelled at their leasure, and got to their much desired Port of _London_, without being disturbed or suspected; but the main Gang alarm'd the Country where-ever they came, drinking and roaring at such a Rate,
_Kennedy_ having spent all his Money, came over from _Ireland_, and kept a common B--y-House on _Deptford_ Road, and now and then, 'twas thought, made an Excursion abroad in the Way of his former Profession, till one of his Houshold W--s gave Information
This Mate, whose Name was _Grant_, paid _Kennedy_ a Visit in _Bridewell_, and knowing him to be the Man, procured a Warrant, and had him committed to the _Marshalsea_ Prison.
The Game that _Kennedy_ had now to play was to turn Evidence himself; accordingly he gave a List of eight or ten of his Comrades; but not being acquainted with their Habitations, one only was taken, who, tho' condemn'd, appeared to be a Man of a fair
The rest of the Pyrates who were left in the Ship _Rover_, staid not long behind, for they went ashore to one of the _West-India_ Islands; what became of them afterwards, I can't tell, but the Ship was found at Sea by a Sloop belonging to St.
Thus we see what a disastrous Fate ever attends the Wicked, and how rarely they escape the Punishment due to their Crimes, who, abandon'd to such a profligate Life, rob, spoil, and prey upon Mankind, contrary to the Light and Law of Nature, as well as the
It might have been hoped, that the Examples of these Deaths, would have been as Marks to the Remainder of this Gang, how to shun the Rocks their Companions had split on; that they would have surrendered to Mercy, or divided themselves, for ever from such

But to go back to _Roberts_, whom we left on the Coast of _Caiana_, in a grievous Passion at what _Kennedy_ and the Crew had done; and who was now projecting new Adventures with his small Company in the Sloop; but finding hitherto they had been but as a

The following, is the Substance of the Articles, as taken from the Pyrates own Informations.
I. E_Very Man has a Vote in Affairs of Moment; has equal Title to the fresh Provisions, or strong Liquors, at any Time seized, and use them at pleasure, unless a Scarcity_ (no uncommon Thing among them) _make it necessary, for the good of all, to vote a

This was a Barbarous Custom of putting the Offender on Shore, on some desolate or uninhabited Cape or Island, with a Gun, a few Shot, a Bottle of Water, and a Bottle of Powder, to subsist with, or starve.
_If the Robbery was only between one another, they contented themselves with slitting the Ears and Nose of him that was Guilty, and set him on Shore, not in an uninhabited Place, but somewhere, where he was sure to encounter Hardships_.
III.
_No Person to Game at Cards or Dice for Money_.
IV.
_The Lights and Candles to be put out at eight o'Clock at Night: If any of the Crew, after that Hour, still remained inclined for Drinking, they were to do it on the open Deck_; which _Roberts_ believed would give a Check to their Debauches, for he was a

VI.
_No Boy or Woman to be allowed amongst them.

_No Man to talk of breaking up their Way of Living, till each had shared a_ 1000 _l.

_ These, we are assured, were some of _Roberts_'s Articles, but as they had taken Care to throw over-board the Original they had sign'd and sworn to, there is a great deal of Room to suspect, the remainder contained something too horrid to be disclosed to
_ And in Case any Doubt should arise concerning the Construction of these Laws, and it should remain a Dispute whether the Party had infring'd them or no, a Jury is appointed to explain them, and bring in a Verdict upon the Case in Doubt.
Since we are now speaking of the Laws of this Company, I shall go on, and, in as brief a Manner as I can, relate the principal Customs, and Government, of this roguish Common-Wealth; which are pretty near the same with all Pyrates.
For the Punishment of small Offences, which are not provided for by the Articles, and which are not of Consequence enough to be left to a Jury, there is a principal Officer among the Pyrates, called the Quarter-Master, of the Mens own chusing, who claims
After a Description of the Quarter-Master, and his Duty, who acts as a sort of a civil Magistrate on Board a Pyrate Ship; I shall consider their military Officer, the Captain; what Privileges he exerts in such anarchy and unrulyness of the Members: Why
The Captain's Power is uncontroulable in Chace, or in Battle, drubbing, cutting, or even shooting any one who dares deny his Command.
The same Privilege he takes over Prisoners, who receive good or ill Usage, mostly as he approves of their Behaviour, for tho' the meanest would take upon them to misuse a Master of a Ship, yet he would controul herein, when he see it, and merrily over a
First, That it preserved his Precedence; and secondly, That it took the Punishment out of the Hands of a much more rash and mad Sett of Fellows than himself.
When he found that Rigour was not expected from his People, (for he often practised it to appease them,) then he would give Strangers to understand, that it was pure Inclination that induced him to a good Treatment of them, and not any Love or Partiality
_ * * * And now seeing the Disadvantages they were under for pursuing the Account, _viz.
_ a small Vessel ill repaired, and without Provisions, or Stores; they resolved one and all, with the little Supplies they could get, to proceed for the _West-Indies_, not doubting to find a Remedy for all these Evils, and to retreive their Loss.
In the Latitude of _Deseada_, one of the Islands, they took two Sloops, which supply'd them with Provisions and other Necessaries; and a few Days afterwards, took a Brigantine belonging to _Rhode Island_, and then proceeded to _Barbadoes_, off of which
Whereupon a _Bristol_ Galley that lay in the Harbour, was ordered to be fitted out with all imaginable Expedition, of 20 Guns, and 80 Men, there being then no Man of War upon that Station, and also a Sloop with 10 Guns, and 40 Men: The Galley was commanded
The second Day after _Rogers_ sailed out of the Harbour, he was discovered by _Roberts_, who knowing nothing of their Design, gave them Chase: The _Barbadoes_ Ships kept an easy sail till the Pyrates came up with them, and then _Roberts_ gave them a Gun,
Captain _Roberts_ sailed in the Sloop to the Island of _Dominico_, where he watered, and got Provisions of the Inhabitants, to whom he gave Goods in Exchange.
At this Place he met with 13 _Englishmen_, who had been set ashore by a _French Guard de la Coste_, belonging to _Martinico_, taken out of two _New-England_ Ships, that had been seiz'd, as Prize, by the said _French_ Sloop: The Men willingly entered with
They staid not long here, tho' they had immediate Occasion for cleaning their Sloop, but did not think this a proper Place, and herein they judg'd right; for the touching at this Island, had like to have been their Destruction, because they having resolved
The Pyrates sailed directly for the _Granadilloes_, and hall'd into a Lagoon, at _Corvocoo_, where they cleaned with unusual Dispatch, staying but a little above a Week, by which Expedition they missed of the _Martinico_ Sloops, only a few Hours; _Roberts_
This was a fortunate Escape, especially considering, that it was not from any Fears of their being discovered, that they made so much hast from the Island; but, as they had the Impudence themselves to own, for the want of Wine and Women.
Thus narrowly escaped, they sailed for _Newfoundland_, and arrived upon the Banks the latter end of _June_, 1720.
They entered the Harbour of _Trepassi_, with their black Colours flying, Drums beating, and Trumpets sounding.
There were two and twenty Vessels in the Harbour, which the Men all quitted upon the Sight of the Pyrate, and fled ashore.
It is impossible particularly to recount the Destruction and Havock they made here, burning and sinking all the shipping, except a _Bristol_ Galley, and destroying the Fisheries, and Stages of the poor Planters, without Remorse or Compunction; for nothing
_They are like mad Men, that cast Fire-Brands, Arrows, and Death, and say, are not we in Sport?
_ _Roberts_ mann'd the _Bristol_ Galley he took in the Harbour, and mounted 16 Guns on Board her, and cruising out upon the Banks, he met with nine or ten Sail of _French_ Ships, all which he destroyed except one of 26 Guns, which they seiz'd, and carried
This Ship they christ'ned _the Fortune_, and leaving the _Bristol_ Galley to the _French_ Men, they sailed away in Company with the Sloop, on another Cruise, and took several Prizes, _viz.
_ the _Richard_ of _Biddiford, Jonathan Whitfield_ Master; the _Willing Mind_ of _Pool_; the _Expectation_ of _Topsham_; and the _Samuel_, Captain _Cary_, of _London_; out of these Ships they encreased their Company, by entring all the Men they could well
The _Samuel_ was a rich Ship, and had several Passengers on Board, who were used very roughly, in order to make them discover their Money, threatning them every Moment with Death, if they did not resign every Thing up to them.

_ After they had brought all the Booty aboard, a Consultation was held whether they should sink or burn the Ship, but whilst they were debating the Matter, they spyed a Sail, and so left the _Samuel_, to give her Chace; at Midnight they came up with the
_ _July_ the 16th, which was two Days afterwards, they took a _Virginia_ Man called the _Little York, James Philips_ Master, and the _Love_, of _Leverpool_, which they plundered and let go; the next Day a Snow from _Bristol_, call'd the _Phoenix, John
When they left the Banks of _Newfoundland_, they sailed for the _West-Indies_, and the Provisions growing short, they went for the Latitude of the Island _Deseada_, to cruise, it being esteemed the likeliest Place to meet with such Ships as (they used in

Sated at length with these Pleasures, and having taken on Board a good supply of fresh Provisions, they voted unanimously for the Coast of _Guiney_, and in the Latitude of 22 N. in their Voyage thither, met with a _French_ Ship from _Martinico_, richly
_Exchange was no Robbery_ they said, and so after a little mock Complaisance to _Monsieur_, for the Favour he had done them, they shifted their Men, and took leave: This was their first _Royal Fortune.
_ In this Ship _Roberts_ proceeded on his designed Voyage; but before they reached _Guiney_, he proposed to touch at _Brava_, the Southermost of _Cape_ _Verd_ Islands and clean.
But here again by an intolerable Stupidity and want of Judgment, they got so far to Leeward of their Port, that despairing to regain it, or any of the Windward Parts of _Africa_, they were obliged to go back again with the Trade-Wind, for the
_Surinam_ was the Place now designed for, which was at no less than 700 Leagues Distance, and they had but one Hogshead of Water left to supply 124 Souls for that Passage; a sad Circumstance that eminently exposes the Folly and Madness among Pyrates, and
Their Sins, we may presume were never so troublesome to their Memories, as now, that inevitable Destruction seem'd to threaten them, without the least Glympse of Comfort or Alleviation to their Misery; for, with what Face could Wretches who had ravaged and

They continued their Course, and came to an Allowance of one single Mouthful of Water for 24 Hours; many of them drank their Urine, or Sea Water, which, instead of allaying, gave them an inextinguishable Thirst, that killed them: Others pined and wasted a
Those that sustain'd the Misery best, were such as almost starved themselves, forbearing all sorts of Food, unless a Mouthful or two of Bread the whole Day, so that those who survived were as weak as it was possible for Men to be and alive.
But if the dismal Prospect they set out with, gave them Anxiety, Trouble, or Pain, what must their Fears and Apprehensions be, when they had not one Drop of Water left, or any other Liquor to moisten or animate.
This was their Case, when (by the working of Divine Providence, no doubt,) they were brought into Soundings, and at Night anchored in seven Fathom Water: This was an inexpressible Joy to them, and, as it were, fed the expiring Lamp of Life with fresh
When the Morning came, they saw Land from the Mast-Head, but it was at so great a Distance, that it afforded but an indifferent Prospect to Men who had drank nothing for the two last Days; however, they dispatch'd their Boat away, and late the same Night

It is the Custom at _Martinico_, for the _Dutch_ Interlopers that have a Mind to Trade with the People of the Island, to hoist their Jacks when they come before the Town: _Roberts_ knew the Signal, and being an utter Enemy to them, he bent his Thoughts
When _Roberts_ had got them within his Power, (one after another,) he told them, he would not have it said that they came off for nothing, and therefore ordered them to leave their Money behind, for that they were a Parcel of Rogues, and hoped they would
_Roberts_ was so enraged at the Attempts that had been made for taking of him, by the Governors of _Barbados_ and _Martinico_, that he ordered a new Jack to be made, which they ever after hoisted, with his own Figure pourtray'd, standing upon two Skulls,
_ At _Dominico_, the next Island they touched at, they took a _Dutch_ Interloper of 22 Guns and 75 Men, and a Brigantine belonging to _Rhode-Island_, one _Norton_ Master.
The former made some Defence, till some of his Men being killed, the rest were discouraged and struck their Colours.
With these two Prizes they went down to _Guadalupe_, and brought out a Sloop, and a _French_ Fly-Boat laden with Sugar; the Sloop they burnt, and went on to _Moonay_, another Island, thinking to clean, but finding the Sea ran too high there to undertake it

_ They passed some Time here, after they had got their Vessel ready, in their usual Debaucheries; they had taken a considerable Quanty of Rum and Sugar, so that Liquor was as plenty as Water, and few there were, who denied themselves the immoderate Use of
This was evident in the Affair of _Harry Glasby_, chosen Master of the _Royal Fortune_, who, with two others, laid hold of the Opportunity at the last Island they were at, to move off without bidding Farewel to his Friends.
_Glasby_ was a reserved sober Man, and therefore gave Occasion to be suspected, so that he was soon missed after he went away; and a Detachment being sent in quest of the Deserters, they were all three brought back again the next Day.
This was a capital Offence, and for which they were ordered to be brought to an immediate Tryal.
Here was the Form of Justice kept up, which is as much as can be said of several other Courts, that have more lawful Commissions for what they do.
--Here was no feeing of Council, and bribing of Witnesses was a Custom not known among them; no packing of Juries, no torturing and wresting the Sense of the Law, for bye Ends and Purposes, no puzzling or perplexing the Cause with unintelligible canting
The Place appointed for their Tryals, was the Steerage of the Ship; in order to which, a large Bowl of Rum Punch was made, and placed upon the Table, the Pipes and Tobacco being ready, the judicial Proceedings began; the Prisoners were brought forth, and
All the Prisoners pleaded for Arrest of Judgment very movingly, but the Court had such an Abhorrence of their Crime, that they could not be prevailed upon to shew Mercy, till one of the Judges, whose Name was _Valentine Ashplant_, stood up, and taking his
-- _By G--_, Glasby _shall not dye; d--n me if he shall.
_ After this learned Speech, he sat down in his Place, and resumed his Pipe.
This Motion was loudly opposed by all the rest of the Judges, in equivalent Terms; but _Ashplant_, who was resolute in his Opinion, made another pathetical Speech in the following Manner.
_G-- d--n ye Gentlemen, I am as good a Man as the best of you; d--m my_ S--l _if ever I turned my Back to any Man in my Life, or ever will, by G_--; Glasby _is an honest Fellow, notwithstanding this Misfortune, and I love him, D--l d--n me if I don't: I
_ And thereupon, he pulled out a pair of Pistols, and presented them to some of the learned Judges upon the Bench; who, perceiving his Argument so well supported, thought it reasonable that _Glasby_ should be acquitted; and so they all came over to his
But all the Mitigation that could be obtained for the other Prisoners, was, that they should have the Liberty of choosing any four of the whole Company to be their Executioners.
The poor Wretches were ty'd immediately to the Mast, and there shot dead, pursuant to their villainous Sentence.
When they put to Sea again, the Prizes which had been detained only for fear of spreading any Rumour concerning them, which had like to have been so fatal at _Corvocoo_, were thus disposed of: They burnt their own Sloop, and mann'd _Norton_'s Brigantine,
With the _Royal Fortune_, and the Brigantine, which they christened the _Good Fortune_, they pushed towards the Latitude of _Deseada_, to look out for Provisions, being very short again, and just to their Wish, Captain _Hingstone_'s ill Fortune brought him
In their Passage thither, they took Numbers of Ships of all Nations, some of which they burnt or sunk, as the Carriage or Characters of the Masters displeased them.
Notwithstanding the successful Adventures of this Crew, yet it was with great Difficulty they could be kept together, under any kind of Regulation; for being almost always mad or drunk, their Behaviour produced infinite Disorders, every Man being in his
When _Roberts_ saw there was no managing of such a Company of wild ungovernable Brutes, by gentle means, nor to keep them from drinking to excess, the Cause of all their Disturbances, he put on a rougher Deportment, and a more magesterial Carriage towards
_ About 400 Leagues from the Coast of _Africa_, the Brigantine who had hitherto lived with them, in all amicable Correspondence, thought fit to take the Opportunity of a dark Night, and leave the Commadore, which leads me back to the Relation of an
Captain _Roberts_ having been insulted by one of the drunken Crew, (whose Name I have forgot,) he, in the Heat of his Passion killed the Fellow on the Spot, which was resented by a great many others, put particularly one _Jones_, a brisk active young Man,
This _Jones_ was at that Time ashore a watering the Ship, but as soon as he came on Board, was told that Captain _Roberts_ had killed his Comrade; upon which he cursed _Roberts_, and said, he ought to be served so himself.
_Roberts_ hearing _Jones_'s Invective, ran to him with a Sword, and ran him into the Body; who, notwithstanding his Wound, seized the Captain, threw him over a Gun, and beat him handsomely.
This Adventure put the whole Company in an Uproar, and some taking Part with the Captain, and others against him, there had like to have ensued a general Battle with one another, like my Lord _Thomont_'s Cocks; however, the Tumult was at length appeas'd by
This severe Punishment did not at all convince _Jones_ that he was in the wrong, but rather animated him to some sort of a Revenge; but not being able to do it upon _Roberts_'s Person, on Board the Ship, he and several of his Comrades, correspond with
What made _Anstis_ a Malecontent, was, the Inferiority he stood in, with Respect to _Roberts_, who carried himself with a haughty and magisterial Air, to him and his Crew, he regarding the Brigantine only as a Tender, and, as such, left them no more than
In short, _Jones_ and his Consort go on Board of Captain _Anstis_, on Pretence of a Visit, and there consulting with their Brethren, they find a Majority for leaving of _Roberts_, and so came to a Resolution to bid a soft Farewel, as they call it, that
I shall have no more to say of Captain _Anstis_, till the Story of _Roberts_ is concluded, therefore I return to him, in the pursuit of his Voyage to _Guiney.
_ The loss of the Brigantine was a sensible Shock to the Crew, she being an excellent Sailor, and had 70 Hands aboard; however, _Roberts_ who was the Occasion of it, put on a Face of Unconcern at this his ill Conduct and Mismanagement, and resolved not to

With these Prizes they went into _Sierraleon_, and made one of them their Consort, by the Name of the _Ranger_, and the other a Store-Ship, to clean by.

There are about 30 _English_ Men in all, Men who in some Part of their Lives, have been either privateering, buccaneering, or pyrating, and still retain and love the Riots, and Humours, common to that sort of Life.
They live very friendly with the Natives, and have many of them of both Sexes, to be their _Grometta_'s, or Servants: The Men are faithful, and the Women so obedient, that they are very ready to prostitute themselves to whomsoever their Masters shall
The Royal _African_ Company has a Fort on a small Island call'd _Bence_ Island, but 'tis of little Use, besides keeping their Slaves; the Distance making it incapable of giving any Molestation to their Starboard Shore.
Here lives at this Place an old Fellow, who goes by the Name of _Crackers_, who was formerly a noted Buccaneer, and while he followed the Calling, robb'd and plundered many a Man; he keeps the best House in the Place, has two or three Guns before his Door,

Hither _Roberts_ came the End of _June_, 1721, and had Intelligence that the _Swallow_, and _Weymouth_, two Men of War, of 50 Guns each, had left that River about a Month before, and designed to return about _Christmas_; so that the Pyrates could indulge
So after six Weeks stay, the Ships being cleaned and fitted, and the Men weary of whoring and drinking, they bethought themselves of Business, and went to Sea the Beginning of _August_, taking their Progress down the whole Coast, as low as _Jaquin_,
In this Range, they exchanged their old _French_ Ship, for a fine Frigate built Ship, call'd the _Onslow_, belonging to the Royal _African_ Company, Captain _Gee_ Commander, which happened to lye at _Sestos_, to get Water and Necessaries for the Company.
A great many of Captain _Gee_'s Men were ashore, when _Robert_'s bore down, and so the Ship consequently surpriz'd into his Hands, tho' had they been all on Board, it was not likely the Case would have been otherwise, the Sailors, most of them, voluntarily
There was a Clergyman on Board the _Onslow_, sent from _England_, to be Chaplain of _Cape-Corso-Castle_, some of the Pyrates were for keeping him, alledging merrily, that their Ship wanted a Chaplain; accordingly they offered him a Share, to take on with
The Pyrates kept the _Onslow_ for their own Use, and gave Captain _Gee_ the _French_ Ship, and then fell to making such Alterations as might fit her for a Sea-Rover, pulling down her Bulk-Heads, and making her flush, so that she became, in all Respects, as

But his Boatswain, _Philips_, took upon him to be the Mouth of the People, and put an End to the Dispute; he said plainly, he would not, laid down his Arms in the King's Name, as he was pleased to term it, and called out to the Boat for Quarters, so that
When they came on Board, they brought her under Sail, by an expeditious Method, of cutting the Cable; _Walden_, one of the Pyrates, telling the Master, this _yo hope_ of heaving up the Anchor was a needless trouble, when they designed to burn the Ship.
They brought her under Commadore _Roberts_'s Stern, and not only rifled her of what Sails, Cordage, _&c.

On the same Day also, they took the _Flushing_, a _Dutch_ Ship, robbed her of Masts, Yards and Stores, and then cut down her Fore-Mast; but what sat as heavily as any thing with the _Skipper_, was, their taking some fine Sausages he had on Board, of his

A Cruelty unparalell'd!
And for which had every Individual been hanged, few I imagine would think that Justice had been rigorous.

The _Swallow_ and _Weymouth_ left _Sierraleon, May_ 28, where, I have already taken Notice, _Roberts_ arrived about a Month after, and doubtless learn'd the Intent of their Voyage, and cleaning on the Coast; which made him set down with more Security to

The natural Result therefore, from these two Advices, was, to hasten for _Whydah_; for it was conclued the Prizes they had taken, had informed them how nigh the _Swallow_ was, and withal, how much better in Health than she had been for some Months past; so
The _Swallow_ weighed from _Cape-Corso, January_ the 10th, but was retarded by waiting some Hours on the _Margaret_, a Company's Ship, at _Accra_, again on the _Portugal_, and a whole Day at _Apong_, on a Person they used to stile _Miss Betty_: A Conduct
This, however, hinder'd the _Swallow_'s catching them at _Whydah_, for the Pyrates came into that Road, with a fresh Gale of Wind, the same Day the _Swallow_ was at _Apong_, and sail'd the 13th of _January_ from thence, that she arrived the 17th.
She gained Notice of them by a _French_ Shallop from _Grand Papa_, the 14th at Night, and from _Little Papa_ next Morning by a _Dutch_ Ship; so that the Man of War was on all Sides, as she thought, sure of her Purchase, particularly when she made the

While they were contemplating on the Matter, a Letter was received from Mr. _Baldwin_, (Governor here for the Company,) signifying, that the Pyrates were at _Jaquin_, seven Leagues lower.
The _Swallow_ weighed at two next Morning, _January_ the 16th, and got to _Jaquin_ by Day-Light, but to no other End, than frightening the Crews of two _Portuguese_ Ships on Shore, who took her for the Pyrate that had struck such Terror at _Whydah_: She

The Pyrates had such an Opinion of their own Courage, that they could never dream any Body would use a Stratagem to speak with them, and so was the more easily drawn into the Snare.
The Pyrates now drew nigh enough to fire their Chase Guns; they hoisted the black Flag that was worn in _Whydah_ Road, and got their Spritsail Yard along-ships, with Intent to board; no one having ever asked, all this while, what Country Ship they took the
After the first Surprize was over, they kept firing at a Distance, hoisted it again, and vapoured with their Cutlashes on the Poop; tho' wisely endeavouring at the same Time to get away.
Being now at their Wits end, boarding was proposed by the Heads of them, and so to make one desperate Push; but the Motion not being well seconded, and their Main-Top-Mast coming down by a Shot, after two Hours firing, it was declin'd; they grew Sick,
She had 32 Guns, mann'd with 16 _French_ Men, 20 Negroes, and 77 _English.
_ The Colours were thrown over board, that they might not rise in Judgment, nor be display'd in Tryumph over them.
While the _Swallow_ was sending their Boat to fetch the Prisoners, a Blast and Smoak was seen to pour out of the great Cabin, and they thought they were blowing up; but upon enquiry afterwards, found that half a dozen of the most Desperate, when they saw
This Ship was commanded by one _Skyrme_, a _Welch_ Man, who, tho' he had lost his Leg in the Action, would not suffer himself to be dressed, or carried off the Deck; but, like _Widrington_, fought upon his Stump.
The rest appeared gay and brisk, most of them with white Shirts, Watches, and a deal of Silk Vests, but the Gold-Dust belonging to them, was most of it left in the _Little Ranger_ in the Bay, (this Company's proper Ship,) with the _Royal Fortune.
_ I cannot but take Notice of two among the Crowd, of those disfigured from the Blast of Powder just before mentioned, _viz.
William Main_ and _Roger Ball.
_ An Officer of the Ship seeing a Silver Call hang at the Wast of the former, said to him, _I presume you are Boatswain of this Ship.
Then you presume wrong_, answered he, _for I am Boatswain of the_ Royal Fortune, _Captain_ Roberts _Commander.
Then Mr._ Boatswain _you will be hanged I believe_, replies the Officer.
_That is as your Honour pleases_, answered he again, and was for turning away: But the Officer desired to know of him, how the Powder, which had made them in that Condition, came to take Fire.
--_By G_-- says he, _they are all mad and bewitch'd, for I have lost a good Hat by it.
_ (the Hat and he being both blown out of the Cabin Gallery, into the Sea.
) _But what signifies a Hat Friend_, says the Officer.
-_Not much_ answer'd he, the Men being busy in stripping him of his Shoes and Stockings.
--The Officer then enquired of him, whether _Roberts_'s Company were as likely Fellows as these.
-- _There are_ 120 _of them_, (answered he) _as clever Fellows as ever trod Shoe Leather: Would I were with them!
--No doubt on't_, says the Officer.
--_By G-- it is naked Truth_, answered he, looking down and seeing himself, by this Time, quite striped.
The Officer then approached _Roger Ball_, who was seated in a private Corner, with a Look as sullen as Winter, and asked him, how he came blown up in that frightful Manner.
--_Why_, says he, John Morris _fired a Pistol into the Powder, and if he had not done it, I would_, (bearing his Pain without the least Complaint.
) The Officer gave him to understand he was Surgeon, and if he desired it, he would dress him; but he swore it should not be done, and that if any Thing was applied to him, he would tear it off.
--Nevertheless the Surgeon had good Nature enough to dress him, tho' with much trouble: At Night he was in a kind of _Delirium_, and raved on the Bravery of _Roberts_, saying, he should shortly be released, as soon as they should meet him, which procured
They secured the Prisoners with Pinions, and Shackles, but the Ship was so much disabled in the Engagement, that they had once Thoughts to set her on Fire; but this would have given them the Trouble of taking the Pyrates wounded Men on Board themselves,
On the 9th in the Evening, the _Swallow_ gained the Cape again, and saw the _Royal Fortune_ standing into the Bay with the _Neptune_, Captain _Hill_, of _London_: A good Presage of the next Day's Success, for they did not doubt but the Temptation of
On the 10th, in the Morning, the Man of War bore away to round the Cape.
_Roberts_'s Crew discerning their Masts over the Land, went down into the Cabin, to acquaint him of it, he being then at Breakfast with his new Guest, Captain _Hill_, on a savory Dish of Solomongundy, and some of his own Beer.
He took no Notice of it, and his Men almost as little, some saying she was a _Portuguese_ Ship, others a _French_ Slave Ship, but the major Part swore it was the _French Ranger_ returning, and were merrily debating for some Time, on the Manner of
And hardly refrained from Blows.
What his own Apprehensions were, till she hawled up her Ports, and hoisted their proper Colours, is uncertain; but then being perfectly convinced, he slipped his Cable, got under Sail, and ordered his Men to Arms, without any shew of Timidity, dropping a

The Danger was imminent, and Time very short, to consult of Means to extricate himself; his Resolution in this Streight, was as follows: To pass close to the _Swallow_, with all their Sails, and receive her Broadside, before they returned a Shot; if
_Roberts_ himself made a gallant Figure, at the Time of the Engagement, being dressed in a rich crimson Damask Wastcoat and Breeches, a red Feather in his Hat, a Gold Chain round his Neck, with a Diamond Cross hanging to it, a Sword in his Hand, and two

They presently threw him over-board, with his Arms and Ornaments on, according to the repeated Request he made in his Life-time.
_Roberts_ was a tall black Man, near forty Years of Age, born at _Newey-bagh_, nigh _Haverford-West_, in _Pembrokshire_, of good natural Parts, and personal Bravery, tho' he applied them to such wicked Purposes, as made them of no Commendation, frequently
_ He was forc'd himself at first among this Company out of the _Prince_, Captain _Plumb_ at _Anamaboe_, about three Years before, where he served as second Mate, and shed, as he us'd to tell the _fresh Men_, as many Crocodile Tears then as they did now,
He could not plead Want of Employment, nor Incapacity of getting his Bread in an honest way, to favour so vile a Change, nor was he so much a Coward as to pretend it; but frankly own'd, it was to get rid of the disagreeable Superiority of some Masters he

Yet among all the vile and ignominious Acts he had perpetrated, he is said to have had an Aversion towards forcing Men into that Service, and had procured some their Discharge, notwithstanding so many made it their Plea.
When _Roberts_ was gone, as tho' he had been the Life and Soul of the Gang, their Spirits sunk; many deserted their Quarters, and all stupidly neglected any Means for Defence, or Escape; and their Main-mast soon after being shot by the Board, they had no

The Flag could not be got easily from under the fallen Mast, and was therefore recover'd by the _Swallow_; it had the Figure of a Skeleton in it, and a Man pourtray'd with a flaming Sword in his Hand, intimating a Defyance of Death it self.
The _Swallow_ returned back into Cape _Lopez_ Bay, and found the little _Ranger_, whom the Pyrates had deserted in hast, for the better Defence of the Ship: She had been plunder'd, according to what I could learn, of 2000 l.
in Gold-Dust, (the Shares of those Pyrates who belonged to her;) and Captain _Hill_, in the _Neptune_, not unjustly suspected, for he would not wait the Man of War's returning into the Bay again, but sail'd away immediately, making no Scruple afterwards to
_All Persons who after the_ 29_th of_ Septem.
1690, &c.
To sum up the whole, if it be considered, first, that the sickly State of the Men of War, when they sail'd from _Princes_, was the Misfortune that hindered their being as far as _Sierraleon_, and consequently out of the Track the Pyrates then took.
That those Pyrates, directly contrary to their Design, in the second Expedition, should get above Cape _Corso_, and that nigh _Axim_, a Chace should offer, that inevitably must discover them, and be soon communicated to the Men of War.
That the satiating their evil and malicious Tempers at _Whydah_, in burning the _Porcupine_, and running off with the _French_ Ship, had strengthened the _Swallow_ with 30 Men.
That the _Swallow_ should miss them in that Road, where probably she had not, or at least so effectually obtained her End.
That they should be so far infatuated at Cape _Lopez_, as to divide their Strength, which when collected, might have been so formidable.
And lastly, that the Conquest should be without Bloodshed: I say, considering all these Circumstances, it shews that the Hand of Providence was concerned in their Destruction.
As to their Behaviour after they were taken, it was found that they had great Inclinations to rebel, if they could have laid hold of any Opportunity.
For they were very uneasy under Restraint, having been lately all Commanders themselves; nor could they brook their Diet, or Quarters, without cursing and swearing, and upbraiding each other, with the Folly that had brought them to it.
So that to secure themselves against any mad desperate Undertaking of theirs, they strongly barricado'd the Gun-Room, and made another Prison before it; an Officer, with Pistols and Cutlashes, doing Duty, Night and Day, and the Prisoners within, manacled
They would yet in these Circumstances be impudently merry, saying, when they viewed their Nakedness, _that they had not left them a halfpenny, to give old_ Charon, _to ferry them over_ Stix: And at their thin Commons, they would observe, that they fell

Heaven_, says the other, _I hope.
Heaven, you Fool_, says _Sutton, did you ever hear of any Pyrates going thither?

_ And when he found such ludicrous Expressions had no Effect on him, he made a formal Complaint, and requested that the Officer would either remove this Man, or take his Prayer-Book away, as a common Disturber.
A Combination and Conspiracy was formed, betwixt _Moody, Ashplant, Magnes, Mare_, and others, to rise, and kill the Officers, and run away with the Ship.
This they had carried on by Means of a Mulatto Boy, who was allow'd to attend them, and proved very trusty in his Messages, between the Principals; but the Evening of that Night they were to have made this Struggle, two of the Prisoners that sat next to
In the same Passage to Cape _Corso_, the Prize, _Royal Fortune_, was in the same Danger.
She was left at the Island of St. _Thomas_'s, in the Possession of an Officer, and a few Men, to take in some fresh Provisions, (which were scarce at Cape _Corso_) with Orders to follow the Ship.
There were only some of the Pyrates Negroes, three or four wounded Prisoners, and _Scudamore_, their Surgeon; from whom they seemed to be under no Apprehension, especially from the last, who might have hoped for Favour, on Account of his Employ; and had

One of them abhorring the Cruelty, or fearing the Success, discovered it to the Officer, who made him immediately a Prisoner, and brought the Ship safe.

The Court well knew, it was not possible to get the Evidence of every Sufferer by this Crew, and therefore, first of all, considered how that Deficiency should be supplied; whether, or no, they could pardon one _Jo.

Another great Difficulty in their Proceedings, was, how to understand those Words in the Act of Parliament, of, _particularly specifying in the Charge, the Circumstances of Time, Place_, &c.
_i.

To reconcile all Things, therefore, the Court resolved, to bottom the whole of their Proceedings on the _Swallow's_ Depositions, which were clear and plain, and had the Circumstance of Time when, Place where, Manner how, and the like, particularly
But this admitted only a general Intimation of Robbery in the Indictment, therefore _to approve their Clemency_, it looking Arbitrary on the Lives of Men, to lump them to the Gallows, in such a summary Way as must have been done, had they solely adhered to
Secondly, _That the Prisoners might not be ignorant whereon to answer_, and so have all fair Advantages, to excuse and defend themselves; the Court farther agreed with Justice and Equanimity, to hear any Evidence that could be brought, to weaken or

Y_E, and every one of you, are in the Name, and by the Authority, of our dread Sovereign Lord_, George, _King of_ Great Britain, _indicted as follows_; _Forasmuch as in open Contempt of the Laws of your Country, ye have all of you been wickedly united, and
And have in Conformity to the most evil and mischievous Intentions, been twice down the Coast of_ Africa, _with two Ships; once in the Beginning of_ August, _and a second Time, in_ January _last, sinking, burning, or robbing such Ships, and Vessels, as
_ _Particularly, ye stand charged at the Instance, and Information of Captain_ Chaloner Ogle, _as Traytors and Pyrates, for the unlawful Opposition ye made to his Majesty's Ship, the_ Swallow, _under his Command.
_ _For that on the_ 5_th of_ February _last past, upon Sight of the aforesaid King's Ship, ye did immediately weigh Anchor from under Cape_ Lopez, _on the Southern Coast of_ Africa, _in a_ French _built Ship of_ 32 _Guns, called the_ Ranger, _and did
_ _That about Ten of the Clock the same Morning, drawing within Gun-shot of his Majesty's aforesaid Ship the_ Swallow, _ye hoisted a pyratical black Flag, and fired several chace Guns, to deter, as much as ye were able, his Majesty's Servants from their
_ _That an Hour after this, being very nigh to the aforesaid King's Ship, ye did audaciously continue in a hostile Defence and Assault, for about two Hours more, in open Violation of the Laws, and in Defiance to the King's Colours and Commission.
_ _And lastly, that in the acting, and compassing of all this, ye were all, and every one of you, in a wicked Combination, voluntarily to exert, and actually did, in your several Stations, use your utmost Endeavours to distress the said King's Ship, and
_ To which they severally pleaded, _Not Guilty.
_ * * * Then the Court called for the Officers of the _Swallow_, Mr. _Isaac Sun_, Lieutenant, _Ralph Baldrick_, Boatswain, _Daniel Maclauglin_, Mate, desiring them to view the Prisoners, whether they knew them?
And to give an Account in what Manner they had attack'd and fought the King's Ship; and they agreed as follows.
That they had viewed all the Prisoners, as they stood now before the Court, and were assured they were the same taken out of one, or other, of the Pyrate Ships, _Royal Fortune_, or _Ranger_; but verily believe them to be taken out of the _Ranger.
_ That they did in the King's Ship, at break of Day, on _Monday_, the 5th of _February_, 1721-2, discover three Ships at Anchor, under Cape _Lopez_, on the Southern Coast of _Africa_; the Cape bearing then W. S. W. about three Leagues, and perceiving one
The King's Ship was obliged to hawl off N. W. and W. N. W. to avoid a Sand, called, the _French Man's Bank_, the Wind then at S. S. E. and found in half an Hour's time, one of the three had got under Sail from the Careen, and was bending her Sails, in a
To encourage this Rashness and Precipitancy, they kept away before the Wind, (as though afraid,) but with their Tacks on Board, their Main-Yard braced, and making, at the same Time, very bad Steerage.
About half an Hour after Ten, in the Morning, the Pyrate Ship came within Gun-shot, and fired four Chace Guns, hoisted a black Flag at the Mizen-Peek, and got their Sprit-sail Yard under their Bowsprit, for boarding.
In half an Hour more, approaching still nigher, they Starboarded their Helm, and gave her a Broadside, the Pyrate bringing to, and returning the same.
After this, the Deponents say, their Fire grew slack for some Time, because the Pyrate was shot so far a Head on the Weather-Bow, that few of their Guns could Point to her; yet in this Interval their black Flag was either Shot away, or hawled down a little
At length, by their ill Steerage, and Favour of the Wind, they came near, a second Time; and about Two in the Afternoon shot away their Main-topmast.
The Colours they fought under, besides a black Flag, were a red _English_ Ensign, a King's Jack, and a _Dutch_ Pendant, which they struck at, or about, Three in the Afternoon, and called for Quarters; it proving to be a _French_ built Ship of 32 Guns,
_ _Isaac Sun_, _Ralph Baldrick_, _Daniel Maclauglin.
_ When the Evidence had been heard, the Prisoners were called upon to answer, how they came on Board this Pyrate Ship; and their Reason for so audacious a Resistance, as had been made against the King's Ship.
To this, each, in his Reply, owned himself to be one of those taken out of the _Ranger_; that he had signed their pyratical Articles, and shared in their Plunder, some few only accepted, who had been there too short a Time.
But that neither in this signing, or sharing, nor in the Resistance had been made against his Majesty's Ship, had they been Voluntiers, but had acted in these several Parts, from a Terror of Death; which a Law amongst them, was to be the Portion of those
The Court then ask'd, who made those Laws?
How those Guns came to be fired?
Or why they had not deserted their Stations, and mutinied, when so fair a Prospect of Redemption offered?
They replied still, with the same Answers, and could extenuate their Crimes, with no other Plea, than being forced Men.
Wherefore the Court were of Opinion, that the Indictment, as it charged them with an unlawful Attack and Resistance of the King's Ship, was sufficiently proved; but then it being undeniably evident, that many of these Prisoners had been forced, and some of

_ _Particularly ye stand indicted at the Information and Instance of Captain_ Chaloner Ogle, _as Traytors, Robbers, Pyrates, and common Enemies to Mankind.
_ _For that on the_ 10_th of_ February _last, in a Ship ye were possess'd of called the_ Royal Fortune, _of_ 40 _Guns, ye did maintain a hostile Defence and Resistance for some Hours, against his Majesty's Ship the_ Swallow, _nigh Cape_ Lopez _Bay, on the

_ To which they severally pleaded, _Not Guilty.
_ * * * Whereupon the Officers of his Majesty's Ship, the _Swallow_, were called again, and testified as follows.
That they had seen all the Prisoners now before the Court, and knew them to be the same which were taken out of one or other of the Pyrate Ships, _Royal Fortune_ or _Ranger_, and verily believe them to be those taken out of the _Royal Fortune.
_ That the Prisoners were possess'd of a Ship of 40 Guns, called the _Royal Fortune_, and were at an Anchor under Cape _Lopez_, on the Coast of _Africa_, with two others: When his Majesty's Ship the _Swallow_, (to which the Deponents belong'd, and were
At Eleven, the Pyrate was within Pistol-Shot, a Breast of them, with a black Flag, and Pendant hoisted at their Main-topmast Head.
The Deponents say, they then struck the _French_ Ensign that had continued hoisted at their Staff all the Morning till then; and display'd the King's Colours, giving her, at the same Time, their Broadside, which was immediately returned.
The Pyrate's Mizen-topmast fell, and some of her Rigging was torn, yet she still out sailed the Man of War, and slid half Gun-Shot from them, while they continued to fire without Intermission, and the other to return such Guns as could be brought to bear,
At Two she struck her Colours, and called for Quarters, proving to be a Ship, formerly call'd the _Onslow_, but by them, the _Royal Fortune_; and the Prisoners from her, assured them, that the smallest Ship of the two, then remaining in the Road, belong'd
_Isaac Sun_, _Ralph Baldrick_, _Daniel Maclaughlin.
_ The Prisoners were asked by the Court, to the same Purpose the others had been in the Morning; what Exception they had to make against what had been sworn?
And what they had to say in their Defence?
And their Reply were much the same with the other Prisoners; that they were forc'd Men, had not fired a Gun in this Resistance against the _Swallow_, and that what little Assistance they did give on this Occasion, was to the Sails and Rigging, to comply
The Court, to dispense equal Justice, mercifully resolved for these, as they had done for the other Pyrate Crew; that further Evidence should be heard against each Man singly, to the two Points, of being a Voluntier at first, and to their particular Acts

_ I was a Prisoner, Sir, with the Pyrates when their Boat was ordered upon that Service, and found, upon a Resolution of going, Word was passed through the Company, Who would go?
And I saw all that did, did it voluntarily; no Compulsion, but rather pressing who should be foremost.
The Prisoners yielded to what had been sworn about the Attack and Robbery, but denied the latter Evidence, saying, _Roberts_ hector'd, and upbraided them of Cowardice on this very Occasion; and told some, they were very ready to step on Board of a Prize

Why would Men, honestly disposed, give their Votes for such a Captain and such a Quarter-Master as were every Day commanding them on distastful Services?
Here succeeded a Silence among the Prisoners, but at length _Fernon_ very honestly own'd, that he did not give his Vote to _Magnes_, but to _David Sympson_ (the old Quarter-Master,) _for in Truth_, says he, _I took_ Magnes _for too honest a Man, and unfit

The other _English_ had been a very few Days on Board the Pyrate, only from _Whydah_ to Cape _Lopez_, and no Capture or Robbery done by them in that Time.
And the _French_ Men were brought with a Design to reconduct their own Ship (or the _Little Ranger_ in Exchange) to _Whydah_ Road again, and were used like Prisoners; neither quarter'd nor suffered to carry Arms.

_Benj.
Kreft_ Master, and _James Groet_ Mate of the _Gertruycht_, taken nigh _Gabone_ in _December_ last, and Mr. _Castel, Wingfield_ and others, that had been Prisoners with the Pyrates.
The former deposed, that all these Prisoners (excepting _Hardy_) were on Board at the Robbery and Plunder of their Ships, behaving in a vile outragious Manner, putting them in bodily Fears, sometimes for the Ship, and sometimes for themselves; and in
_ A Reply, I believe, not designed as any sawcy Way of jesting, but to give their Behaviour an Appearance of more Humanity than the _Dutch_ would allow.
From Mr. _Castel, Wingfield_ and others, they were proved to be distinguished Men, Men who were consulted as Chiefs in all Enterprizes; belonged most of them to the House of Lords, (as they call'd it,) and could carry an Authority over others.
The former said, particularly of _Hardy_, (Quarter-Master of the _Ranger_,) that when the _Diligence_ Sloop was taken, (whereto he belonged,) none was busier in the Plunder, and was the very Man who scuttled and sunk that Vessel.
From some of the Prisoners acquitted, it was farther demanded, whether the Acceptance or Refusal of any Office was not in their own Option?
And it was declared, that every Officer was chose by a Majority of Votes, and might refuse, if he pleased, since others gladly embraced what brought with it an additional Share of Prize.

_ _Harry Glasby_, Master.
THere appearing several Persons in Court, who had been taken by _Roberts_'s Ship, whereof the Prisoner was Master, their Evidence was accepted as follows.
_Jo.
Trahern_, Commander of the _King Solomon_, deposed, the Prisoner, indeed, to act as Master of the Pyrate Ship (while he was under Restraint there) but was observed like no Master, every one obeying at Discretion, of which he had taken Notice, and
_Jo.
Wingfield_, a Prisoner with them at _Calabar_, says the same, as to the Quality he acted in, but that he was Civil beyond any of them, and verily believes, that when the Brigantine he served on Board of, as a Factor for the _African_ Company, was voted to
He adds further, that when one _Hamilton_, a Surgeon, was taken by them, and the Articles about to be imposed on him, he opposed, and prevented it.
And that _Hunter_, another Surgeon, among them, was cleared at the Prisoner's Instance and Perswasion; from which last, this Deponent had it assured to him, that _Glasby_ had once been under Sentence of Death, on Board of them, with two more, for

_James White_, whose Business was Musick, and was on the Poop of the Pyrate Ship in Time of Action with the _Swallow_, deposed, that during the Engagement, and Defence she made, he never saw the Prisoner busied about the Guns, or giving Orders, either to
_Isaac Sun_, Lieutenant of the Man of War, deposed, that when he came to take Possession of the Prize, in the King's Boat, he found the Pyrates in a very distracted and divided Condition; some being for blowing up, and others (who perhaps supposed
He had heard also, that after _Roberts_ was killed, the Prisoner ordered the Colours to be struck; and had since shown, how opposite his Practice and Principles had been, by discovering who were the greatest Rogues among them.
The Prisoner, in his own Defence, says, when he had the Misfortune of falling into the Pyrates Hands, he was chief Mate of the _Samuel_, of _London_, Captain _Cary_; and when he had hid himself, to prevent the Design of carrying him away, they found him,
Seven Days afterwards, upon his objecting against, and refusing to sign their Articles, he was cut and abus'd again: That tho' after this he ingratiated himself, by a more humble Carriage, it was only to make Life easy; the Shares they had given him,
He was once taken, he says, at making his Escape, in the _West-Indies_, and, with two more, sentenced to be shot for it, by a drunken Jury; the latter actually suffered, and he was preserved only by one of the chief Pyrates taking a sudden Liking to him,
A second time he ran away at _Hispaniola_, carrying a Pocket Compass, for conducting him through the Woods; but that being a most desolate and wild Part of the Island he fell upon, and he ignorant how to direct his Course, was obliged, after two or three

That altho' he had lost a Leg in the Action, his Temper was so warm, as to refuse going off the Deck, till he found all was lost.
In his Defence, he says, he was forced from a Mate's Employ on Board a Sloop call'd the _Greyhound_, of St. _Christophers, Oct.

The Pyrate having drubbed him, and broke his Head, only for offering to go away when that Sloop was dismissed.

The _President_, called for _Harry Glasby_, and bid him relate a Character of the Prisoner, and what Custom was among them, in Relation to these voluntary Expeditions, out of their proper Ship; and this of going on Board the _Ranger_, in particular.
And he gave in for Evidence, that the Prisoner was looked on as a brisk Hand, (_i.

As to the last Expedition in the _Ranger_, he confesses he went on Board of her, but that it was by _Robert_'s Order; and in the Chace loaded one Gun, to bring her to, but when he saw it was a Bite, he declared to his Comrades, that it was not worth while
Why then, says he, I dont know what I might have done, intimating withal, that every Body then would have been ready enough at plundering.
_Guilty.

_ H_Arry Glasby, Jo.
Wingfield_, and _Nicholas Brattle_, depose thus much, as to his being a Voluntier with the Pyrates, from Capt.
_Rolls_, at _Calabar.
_ First, That he quarrelled with _Moody_, (one of the Heads of the Gang) and fought with him, because he opposed his going, asking _Rolls_, in a leering manner, whether he would not be so kind, as to put him into the _Gazette_, when he came Home.
And, at another Time, when he was going from the Pyrate Ship, in his Boat, a Turnado arose, _I wish_, says he, _the Rascal may be drowned, for he is a great Rogue, and has endeavoured to do me all the ill Offices he could among these Gentlemen_, (_i.

At coming away, the Prisoner asked about his Note, whether the Pyrates had it or no?
Who not being able readily to tell, he reply'd, it's no Matter Mr. _Sharp_, I believe I shall hardly ever come to _England_ to pay it.
_Adam Comry_, Surgeon of the _Elizabeth_, says, that altho' the Prisoner had, on Account of his Indisposition and Want, received many Civilities from him, before meeting with the Pyrates, he yet understood it was thro' his and _Scudamore_'s Means, that he

Yet setting aside these silly Freaks, to recommend himself, his Laziness had got him many Enemies, even _Roberts_ told him, (on the Complaint of a wounded Man, whom he had refused to dress) that he was a double Rogue, to be there a second Time, and
The Evidence further assured the Court, from Captain _Thomas Tarlton_, that the Prisoner was taken out of his Brother's Ship, some Months before, a first Time, and being forward to oblige his new Company, had presently ask'd for the Pyrates Boat, to fetch

_ And at his second coming, in the _Elizabeth_, he heard _Roberts_ order he should be brought on Board in the first Boat.

_Nicholas Butler_, who had remained with the Pyrates about 48 Hours, when they took the _French_ Ships at _Whydah_, deposes, that in this Space the Prisoner addressed him in the _French_ Language, several Times, deploring the Wretchedness and ill Fortune
The Prisoner desiring Liberty of two or three Questions, ask'd, whether or no he had not expostulated with _Roberts_, for a Reason of his obliging Surgeons to sign their Articles, when heretofore they did not; Whether he had not expressed himself glad of
Whether he had not said, at taking the Ships in _Whydah_ Road, that he could like the Sport, were it lawful?
And whether if he had not told him, should the Company discharge any Surgeon, that he would insist on it as his Turn?
The Deponent answered, Yes, to every Question separately; and farther, that he believes _Scudamore_ had not seen _Wilson_ when he first came and found him out of the _Elizabeth.
_ He added, in his own Defence, that being Surgeon with one _John Tarlton_, of _Leverpool_, he was met a first Time on this Coast of _Guiney_, by _Roberts_ the Pyrate; who, after a Day or two, told him, to his Sorrow, that he was to stay there, and ordered
Here he remained five Months, till _Thomas Tarlton_, Brother to his Captain chanced to put in the Road for Trade, to whom he represented his Hardships and starving Condition; but was, in an unchristian Manner, both refused a Release of this Captivity, or
A little Time after this, the Master of a _French_ Ship paid a Ransom for him, and took him off; but, by Reason of a nasty leperous Indisposition he had contracted by hard and bad living, was, to his great Misfortune set ashore at _Sestos_ again, when

_Benjamin Jefferys_ BY the Depositions of _Glasby_ and _Lillburn_ (acquitted) against this Prisoner, it appeared, that his Drunkenness was what at first detained him from going away in his proper Ship, the _Norman_ Galley; and next Morning, for having been
The Deponents further say, that at _Sierraleon_ every Man had more especially the Means of escaping; and that this Prisoner, in particular, neglected it, and came off from that Place after their Ship was under Sail, and going out of the River.
The Prisoner, in his Defence, protests, he was at first forc'd; and that the Office of Boatswain's Mate was imposed on him, and what he would have been glad to have relinquish'd.
That the barbarous Whipping he had received from the Pyrates at first, was for telling them, that none who could get their Bread in an honest Way, would be on such an Account.
And he had certainly taken the Opportunity which presented at _Sierraleon_, of ridding himself from so distastful a Life, if there had not been three or four of the old Pyrates on Shore at the same Time, who, he imagined, must know of him, and would
The Court observed, the Excuses of these Pyrates, about want of Means to escape, was oftentimes as poor and evasive as their Pleas of being forced at first; for here, at _Sierraleon_, every Man had his Liberty on Shore, and it was evident, might have kept
And such are further culpable, who having been introduced into the Society, by such uncivil Methods, as whipping, or beating, neglect less likely Means of regaining Liberty; it shews strong Inclinations to Dishonesty, and they stand inexcusably, _Guilty.

From _Glasby_ and _Lilburn_, it was evident, that every Pyrate, while they stay'd at _Sierraleon_, went on Shore at Discretion.

X. OF Captain _ANSTIS_, And his CREW.
T_HOMAS Anstis_ ship'd himself at _Providence_ in the Year 1718, aboard the _Buck_ Sloop, and was one of six that conspired together to go off a pyrating with the Vessel; the rest were, _Howel Davis, Roberts_'s Predecessor, killed at the Island of
What followed concerning _Anstis_'s Pyracies, has been included in the two preceeding Chapters; I shall only observe that the Combination of these six Men abovementioned, was the Beginning of that Company, that afterwards proved so formidable under Captain
About the Middle of _June_, these Pyrates met with one Captain _Marston_, between _Hispaniola_ and _Jamaica_, bound on a Voyage to _New-York_; from whom they took all the wearing Apparel they could find, as also his Liquors and Provision, and five of his
This Ship had 600 Barrels of Beef aboard, besides other Provisions, and was taken off _Martinico_, wherein Colonel _Doyly_ of _Montserrat_, and his Family were Passengers.
The Colonel was very much abused and wounded, for endeavouring to save a poor Woman, that was also a Passenger, from the Insults of that brutish Crew; and the Pyrates prevailing, twenty one of them forced the poor Creature successively, afterwards broke
I say, I will not be positive it was _Anstis_'s Crew that acted this unheard of Violence and Cruelty, tho' the Circumstances of the Place, the Time, the Force of the Vessel, and the Number of Men, do all concur, and I can place the Villany no where else;
When they thought fit to put an End to this Cruize, they went into one of the Islands to clean, which they effected without any Disturbance, and came out again, and stretching away towards _Burmudas_, met with a stout Ship, called the _Morning Star_, bound
In a Day or two, a Ship from _Barbadoes_ bound to _New-York_, fell into their Hands, and taking out her Guns and Tackle, mounted the _Morning Star_ with 32 Pieces of Cannon, mann'd her with a 100 Men, and appointed one _John Fenn_ Captain; for the
Now, that they had two good Ships well mann'd, it may be supposed they were in a Condition to undertake something bold: But their Government was disturbed by Malecontents, and a Kingdom divided within it self cannot stand; they had such a Number of new Men
_ This being approved of, it was unanimously resolved on, and the underwritten Petition drawn up and signed by the whole Company in the Manner of what they call a _Round Robin_, that is, the Names were writ in a Circle, to avoid all Appearance of
_To his most sacred Majesty_ George, _by the Grace of God, of_ Great-Britain, France _and_ Ireland, _King, Defender of the Faith_, &c.
The humble PETITION of the Company, now belonging to the Ship _Morning Star_, and Brigantine _Good Fortune_, lying under the ignominious Name and Denomination of PYRATES.
Humbly sheweth, T_HAT we your Majesty's most loyal Subjects, have, at sundry Times, been taken by_ Bartholomew Roberts, _the then Captain of the abovesaid Vessels and Company, together with another Ship, in which we left him; and have been forced by him
And, that we your Majesty's most loyal Subjects, may with more Safety return to our native Country, and serve the Nation, unto which we belong, in our respective Capacities, without Fear of being prosecuted by the Injured, whose Estates have suffered by
_ And your Petitioners shall ever pray.
This Petition was sent home by a Merchant Ship bound to _England_, from _Jamaica_, who promised to speak with the Petitioners, in their Return, about 20 Leagues to Windward of that Island, and let them know what Success their Petition met with.
When this was done, the Pyrates retires to the Island before proposed, with the Ship and Brigantine.
This Island (which I have no Name for) lies off the Southwest End of _Cuba_, uninhabited, and little frequented.
On the East End is a Lagune, so narrow, that a Ship can but just go in, tho' there's from 15 to 22 Foot Water, for almost a League up: On both Sides of the Lagune grows red Mangrove Trees, very thick, that the Entrance of it, as well as the Vessels laying
In the Middle of the Island are here and there a small thick Wood of tall Pines, and other Trees scattered about in different Places.
Here they staid about nine Months, but not having Provision for above two, they were forced to take what the Island afforded, which was Fish of several Sorts, particularly Turtle, which latter was the chiefest Food they lived on, and was found in great
There are three or four Sorts of these Creatures in the _West-Indies_, the largest of which will weight 150 or 200 Pound Weight or more, but those that were found upon this Island were of the smallest Kind, weighing 10 or 12 Pounds each, with a fine
_ so that it was no extraordinary Hardship for them to live upon this Provision alone, since it affords variety of Meats to the Taste, of it self.
The manner of catching this Fish is very particular; you must understand, that in the Months of _May, June_ and _July_, they lay their Eggs in order to hatch their Young, and this three times in a Season, which is always in the Sand of the Sea-shore, each
The Male accompanies the Female, and come ashore in the Night only, when they must be watch'd, without making any Noise, or having a Light; as soon as they land, the Men that watch for them, turn them on their Backs, then haul them above high Water Mark,
It is to be observ'd, that besides their laying time, they come ashore to feed, but then what's very remarkable in these Creatures, they always resort to different Places to breed, leaving their usual Haunts for two or three Months, and 'tis thought they
They pass'd their Time here in Dancing, and other Diversions, agreeable to these sort of Folks; and among the rest, they appointed a Mock Court of Judicature to try one another for Pyracy, and he that was a Criminal one Day was made Judge another.
-- I had an Account given me of one of these merry Tryals, and as it appeared diverting, I shall give the Readers a short Account of it.
The Court and Criminals being both appointed, as also Council to plead, the Judge got up in a Tree, and had a dirty Taurpaulin hung over his Shoulders; this was done by Way of Robe, with a Thrum Cap on his Head, and a large Pair of Spectacles upon his
_ instead of Wands, Tipstaves, and such like.
-- The Criminals were brought out, making a thousand sour Faces; and one who acted as Attorney-General opened the Charge against them; their Speeches were very laconick, and their whole Proceedings concise.

--My Lord, I should have spoke much finer than I do now, but that, as your Lordship knows our Rum is all out, and how should a Man speak good Law that has not drank a Dram.
--However, I hope, your Lordship will order the Fellow to be hang'd.

--How dare you talk of considering?
--Sirrah, Sirrah, I never consider'd in all my Life.
--I'll make it Treason to consider.

_Judge.
_ D'ye hear how the Scoundrel prates?
--What have we to do with Reason?
--I'd have you to know, Raskal, we don't sit here to hear Reason;--we go according to Law.
--Is our Dinner ready?
_Attor.
Gen.
_ Yes, my Lord.
_Judge.
_ Then heark'ee, you Raskal at the Bar; hear me, Sirrah, hear me.
--You must suffer, for three Reasons; first, because it is not fit I should sit here as Judge, and no Body be hang'd.
--Secondly, you must be hang'd, because you have a damn'd hanging Look:--And thirdly, you must be hang'd, because I am hungry; for know, Sirrah, that 'tis a Custom, that whenever the Judge's Dinner is ready before the Tryal is over, the Prisoner is to be

--So take him away Goaler.
* * * This is the Tryal just as it was related to me; the Design of my setting it down, is only to shew how these Fellows can jest upon Things, the Fear and Dread of which, should make them tremble.
The beginning of _August_ 1722, the Pyrates made ready the Brigantine, and came out to Sea, and beating up to Windward, lay in the Track for their Correspondant in her Voyage to _Jamaica_, and spoke with her; but finding nothing was done in _England_ in
The next Day Captain _Anstis_ put in, and found that all, or the greatest part of the Crew, were safe ashore, whereupon she came to an Anchor, in order to fetch them off; and having brought _Fenn_ the Captain, _Philips_ the Carpenter, and a few others
_ the _Hector_ and _Adventure_, so that the Brigantine had but just Time to cut their Cable, and get to Sea, with one of the Men of War after her, keeping within Gun-shot for several Hours.
_Anstis_ and his Crew were now under the greatest Consternation imaginable, finding the Gale freshen, and the Man of War gaining Ground upon them, so that, in all Probability, they must have been Prisoners in two Hours more; but it pleased God to give them
The _Hector_ landed her Men upon the Island, and took 40 of the _Morning Star_'s Crew, without any Resistance made by them; but on the contrary, alledging, they were forc'd Men, and that they were glad of this Opportunity to escape from the Pyrates; the
_George Bradley_ the Master, and three more, surrender'd afterwards to a _Burmudas_ Sloop, and were carried to that Island.
The Brigantine, after her Escape, sail'd to a small Island near the Bay of _Honduras_, to clean and refit, and, in her Way thither, took a _Rhode Island_ Sloop, Captain _Durfey_, Commander, and two or three other Vessels, which they destroy'd, but brought
While she was cleaning, a Scheme was concerted between Captain _Durfey_, some other Prisoners, and two or three of the Pyrates, for to seize some of the Chiefs, and carry off the Brigantine; but the same being discovered before she was fit for sailing,
About the beginning of _December_, 1722, _Anstis_ left this Place and return'd to the Islands, designing to accumulate all the Power and Strength he could, since there was no looking back.
He took in the Cruise a good Ship, commanded by Captain _Smith_, which he mounted with 24 Guns, and _Fenn_, a one handed Man, who commanded the _Morning-Star_ when she was lost, went aboard to command her.
They cruis'd together, and took a Vessel or two, and then went to the _Bahama Islands_, and there met with what they wanted, _viz.
_ a Sloop loaded with Provisions, from _Dublin_, called the _Antelope.
_ It was time now to think of some Place to fit up and clean their Frigate lately taken, and put her in a Condition to do Business; accordingly they pitch'd upon the Island of _Tobago_, where they arrived the beginning of _April_, 1723, with the _Antelope_
They fell to work immediately, got the Guns, Stores, and every Thing else out upon the Island, and put the Ship upon the Heel; and just then, as ill Luck would have it, came in the _Winchelsea_ Man of War, by Way of Visit, which put the Marooners into such
_Anstis_, in the Brigantine, escap'd, by having a light Pair of Heels, but it put his Company into such a Disorder, that their Government could never be set to rights again; for some of the New-Comers, and those who had been tir'd with the Trade, put an

But to return to Captain _Fenn_, he was taken stragling with his Gunner and three more, a Day or two after their Misfortune, by the Man of War's Men, and carry'd to _Antegoa_, where they were all executed, and _Fenn_ hang'd in Chains.
Those who remain'd, staid some Time in the Island, keeping up and down in the Woods, with a Hand to look out; at length Providence so order'd it, that a small Sloop came into the Harbour, which they all got aboard of, except two or three Negroes, and those
They did not think fit to pursue any further Adventures, and therefore unanimously resolved to steer for _England_, which they accordingly did, and in _October_ last came into _Bristol_ Channel, sunk the Sloop, and getting ashore in the Boat, dispersed

XI.
OF Captain _WORLEY_, And his CREW.
HIS Reign was but short, but his Beginning somewhat particular, setting out in a small open Boat, with eight others, from _New-York.
_ This was as resolute a Crew as ever went upon this Account: They took with them a few Biscuits, and a dry'd Tongue or two, a little Cag of Water, half a dozen old Muskets and Ammunition accordingly.
Thus provided, they left _New-York_ the latter End of _September_ 1718, but it cannot be supposed that such a Man of War as this, could undertake any considerable Voyage, or attempt any extraordinary Enterprize; so they stood down the Coast, till they came
_ from _Oppoquenimi_ to _Philadelphia_; they made Prize of the most valuable Part of them, and let the Shallop go.
This Fact could not come under the Article of Pyracy, it not being committed _super altum Mare_, upon the High-Sea, therefore was a simple Robbery only; but they did not stand for a Point of Law in the Case, but easing the Shallop Man of his Lading, the
The Shallop came straight to _Philadelphia_, and brought the ill News thither, which so alarm'd the Government, as if War had been declared against them; Expresses were sent to _New-York_, and other Places, and several Vessels fitted out against this
_Worley_ and his Crew, in going down the River, met with a Sloop of _Philadelphia_, belonging to a Mulatto, whom they call'd _Black Robbin_; they quitted their Boat for this Sloop, taking one of _Black Robin_'s Men along with them, as they had also done
A Day or two after, they took another Sloop belonging to _Hull_, homeward bound, which was somewhat fitter for their Purpose; they found aboard her, Provisions and Necessaries, which they stood in need of, and enabled them to prosecute their Design, in a
Upon the Success of these Rovers, the Governor issued out a Proclamation, for the apprehending and taking all Pyrates, who had refused or neglected to surrender themselves, by the Time limited in his Majesty's Proclamation of Pardon; and thereupon, ordered
In all probability, the taking this Sloop sav'd their Bacons, for this Time, tho' they fell into the Trap presently afterwards; for they finding themselves in tolerable good Condition, having a Vessel newly cleaned, with Provisions, _&c.
_ they stood off to Sea, and so missed the _Phoenix_, who expected them to be still on the Coast.
About six Weeks afterwards they returned, having taken both a Sloop and a Brigantine, among the _Bahama_ Islands; the former they sunk, and the other they let go: The Sloop belonged to _New-York_, and they thought the sinking of her good Policy, to prevent
_Worley_ had by this Time encreased his Company to about five and twenty Men, had six Guns mounted, and small Arms as many as were necessary for them, and seem'd to be in a good thriving sort of a Way.
He made a black Ensign, with a white Death's Head in the Middle of it, and other Colours suitable to it.
They all signed Articles, and bound themselves under a solemn Oath, to take no Quarters, but to stand by one another to the last Man, which was rashly fulfill'd a little afterwards.
For going into an Inlet in _North-Carolina_, to clean, the Governor received Information of it, and fitted out two Sloops, one of eight Guns, and the other with six, and about seventy Men between them.
_Worley_ had clean'd his Sloop, and sail'd before the _Carolina_ Sloops reached the Place, and steered to the Northward; but the Sloops just mentioned, pursuing the same Course, came in sight of _Worley_, as he was cruising off the Capes of _Virginia_, and
The two Sloops standing towards the Capes at the same Time, and _Worley_ hoisting of his black Flag, the Inhabitants of _James_ Town were in the utmost Consternation, thinking that all three had been Pyrates, and that their Design had been upon them; so
Soon after two Boats, which were sent out to get Intelligence, came crowding in, and brought an Account, that one of the Pyrates was in the Bay, being a small Sloop of six Guns.
The Governor expecting the rest would have followed, and altogether make some Attempt to land, for the sake of Plunder, beat to Arms, and collected all the Force that could be got together, to oppose them; he ordered all the Guns out of the Ships, to make
The Truth of the Matter is, _Worley_ gained the Bay, thinking to make sure of his two Prizes, by keeping them from coming in; but by the hoisting of the King's Colours, and firing a Gun, he quickly was sensible of his Mistake, and too soon perceived that
When the Pyrates saw how Things went, they resolutely prepar'd themselves for a desperate Defence; and tho' three to one odds, _Worley_ and his Crew determined to fight to the last Gasp, and receive no Quarters, agreeably to what they had before sworn; so
The _Carolina_ Men gave the Pyrate a Broadside, and then Boarded him, one Sloop getting upon his Quarter, and the other on his Bow; _Worley_ and the Crew, drew up upon the Deck, and fought very obstinately, Hand to Hand, so that in a few Minutes, abundance
They were brought ashore in Irons, and the next Day, which was the 17th of _February_ 1718-19, they were both hanged up, for fear they should dye, and evade the Punishment as was thought due to their Crimes.

OF Capt.
_George Lowther_, And his CREW.
G_Eorge Lowther_ sailed out of the River of _Thames_, in one of the Royal _African_ Company's Ships, call'd the _Gambia Castle_, of 16 Guns and 30 Men, _Charles Russel_ Commander; of which Ship, the said _Lowther_ was second Mate.
Aboard of the same Ship, was a certain Number of Soldiers, commanded by one _John Massey_, who were to be carried to one of the Company's Settlements, on the River of _Gambia_, to Garrison a Fort, which was sometime ago taken and destroy'd by Captain
In _May_ 1721, the _Gambia Castle_ came safe to her Port in _Africa_, and landed Captain _Massey_ and his Men on _James_'s Island, where he was to Command under the Governor, Colonel _Whitney_, who arrived there at the same Time, in another Ship: And here,
_ turned against her Masters.
The Names of Governor and Captain sounded great, but when the Gentlemen found that the Power that generally goes along with those Titles, was oversway'd and born down by the Merchants and Factors, (mechanick Fellows as they thought them) they grew very
And as the want of eating was the only Thing that made the great _Sancho_ quit his Government, so did it here rend and tare their's to Pieces: For _Massey_ told them, _that he did not come there to be a_ Guiney _Slave, and that he had promised his Men good
_ The Governor at this Time was very ill of a Fever, and, for the better Accomodation in his Sickness, was carried aboard the Ship _Gambia Castle_, where he continued for about three Weeks, and therefore could have little to say in this Dispute, tho' he
The Merchants had certainly Orders from the Company, to issue the Provisions out to the Garrison, and the same is done along the whole Coast; but whether they had cut them short of the Allowance that was appointed them, I can't say, but if they did, then
However, an Accident that happened on Board the Ship, did not a little contribute to this Misfortune, which was a Pique that the Captain of her took against his second Mate, _George Lowther_, the Man who is the Subject of this short History; and who losing
This served but to widen the Differences between him and the Captain, and more firmly attach'd _Lowther_ to the Ship's Company, the greatest Part of which, he found ripe for any Mischief in the World.
Captain _Massey_ was no wit the better reconciled to the Place, by a longer Continuance, nor to the Usage he met with there, and having often Opportunities of conversing with _Lowther_, with whom he had contracted an Intimacy in the Voyage; they aggravated
When the Governor recover'd of his Fever, he went ashore to the Island, but took no Notice of _Massey_'s Behaviour, tho' it was such as might give Suspicion of what he designed; and _Lowther_, and the common Sailors, who were in the Secret of Affairs, grew
The Captain seeing how Things were carried, goes ashore early one Morning to the Governor and Factory, in order to hold a Council, which _Lowther_ apprehending, was in order to prevent his Design, sent a Letter in the same Boat to _Massey_, intimating it
_ As soon as _Massey_ received this Letter, he went to the Soldiers at the _Barracks_, and said to them, and others, _You that have a Mind to go to_ England, _now is your Time_; and they generally consenting, _Massey_ went to the Store-Room, burst open the
_ But _Lowther_ understanding best, the meaning of those Orders, he confined the chief Mate, shotted the Guns, and put the Ship in a Condition for sailing.
In the Afternoon _Massey_ came on Board with the Governor's Son, having sent off all the Provisions of the Island, and eleven Pipes of Wine, leaving only two half Pipes behind in the Store-House, and dismounted all the Guns of the Fort.
In the Afternoon they weigh'd one Anchor, but fearing to be too late to get out of the River, they slipp'd the other, and so fell down; in doing of which, they run the Ship a-ground.
_Massey_ shew'd himself a Soldier upon this Accident, for as soon as the Misfortune happen'd, he left the Ship with about sixteen Hands, and rows directly to the Fort, remounts the Guns, and keeps Garrison there all the Night, while the Ship was ashore;
In the mean while, _Russel_ came off, but not being suffered to come on Board, he call'd to _Lowther_, and offered him and the Company, whatever Terms they would be pleased to accept of, upon Condition of surrendering up the Ship, which had no Effect upon
In the Morning they got her afloat, and _Massey_ and his Men came aboard, after having nailed up and dismounted all the Cannon of the Fort: They put the Governor's Son, and two or three others ashore, who were not willing to go without the Governor, and
_ that lay there, without doing Execution on either Side.
When the Ship came out to Sea, _Lowther_ called up all the Company, and told them, _it was the greatest Folly imaginable, to think of returning to_ England, _for what they had already done, could not be justifyed upon any Pretence whatsoever, but would be

_THE Captain is to have two full Shares; the Master is to have one Share and a half; the Doctor, Mate, Gunner, and Boatswain, one Share and a quarter.
_ 2.
_He that shall be found Guilty of taking up any unlawful Weapon on Board the Privateer, or any Prize, by us taken, so as to strike or abuse one another, in any regard, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority of the Company shall think fit.

_He that shall be found Guilty of Cowardize, in the Time of Engagement, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority shall think fit.
_ 4.
_If any Gold, Jewels, Silver_, &c.
_be found on Board of any Prize or Prizes, to the Value of a Piece of Eight, and the Finder do not deliver it to the Quarter-Master, in the Space of_ 24 _Hours, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority shall think fit.
_ 5.
_He that is found Guilty of Gaming, or Defrauding another to the Value of a Shilling, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority of the Company shall think fit.
_ 6.
_He that shall have the Misfortune to lose a Limb, in Time of Engagement, shall have the Sum of one hundred and fifty Pounds Sterling, and remain with the Company as long as he shall think fit.

_Good Quarters to be given when call'd for.

_He that sees a Sail first, shall have the best Pistol, or Small-Arm, on Board her.
_ It was the 13th of _June_, that _Lowther_ left the Settlement, and on the 20th, being then within twenty Leagues of _Barbadoes_, he came up with a Brigantine, belonging to _Boston_, called the _Charles, James Douglass_ Master, which they plundered in a
After this the _Delivery_ proceeded to _Hispaniola_; near the West End of the Island she met with a _French_ Sloop loaden with Wine and Brandy; aboard of this Vessel went Captain _Massey_, as a Merchant, and ask'd the Price of one Thing, and then another,
That they must have it all without Money.
Monsieur_ presently understood his Meaning, and unwillingly agreed to the Bargain.
They took out of her thirty Casks of Brandy, five Hogsheads of Wine, several Pieces of Chintzes, and other valuable Goods, and about 70 _l.
English_, in Money; of which _Lowther_ generously return'd five Pounds back to the _French_ Master for his Civilities.
But as all Constitutions grow old, and thereby shake and totter, so did our Commonwealth in about a Month of its Age, feel Commotions and intestine Disturbances, by the Divisions of its Members, which had near hand terminated in its Destruction; these
Captain _Massey_ had been a Soldier almost from his Infancy, but was but very indifferently acquainted with Maritime Affairs, and having an enterprizing Soul, nothing would satisfy him, but he must be doing Business in his own Way, therefore he required
_Lowther_ did all that he could do, and said all that he could say, to disswade _Massey_ from so rash and dangerous an Attempt; pointing out to him the Hazard the Company would run, and the Consequences to them all, if he should not succeed, and the little

then they gave over the Dispute, set all their Sails, and steered after the Chace.
In a few Hours they came up with her, she being a small Ship from _Jamaica_, bound to _England_; they took what they thought fit out of her, and a Hand or two, and then _Lowther_ was for sinking the Ship, with several Passengers that were in her, for what
_ The next Day they took a small Sloop, an interloping Trader, which they detain'd with her Cargo.
All this while _Massey_ was uneasy, and declar'd his Resolution to leave them, and _Lowther_ finding him a very troublesome Man to deal with, consented that he should take the Sloop, last made Prize of, with what Hands had a Mind to go with him, and shift
Whereupon _Massey_, with about ten more Malecontents, goes aboard the Sloop, and comes away in her directly for _Jamaica.
_ Notwithstanding what had passed, Captain _Massey_ puts a bold Face upon the Matter, and goes to Sir _Nicholas Laws_, the Governor, informs him of his leaving _Lowther_ the Pyrate, owns, _That he assisted in going off with the Ship, at the River_ Gambia;
_ _Massey_ was very well received by the Governor, and had his Liberty given him, with a Promise of his Favour, and so forth; and, at his own Request, he was sent on Board the _Happy_ Sloop, Captain _Laws_, to cruise off _Hispaniola_, for _Lowther_; but
_ When _Massey_ came to Town, he writes a long Letter to the Deputy Governor and Directors of the _African_ Company, wherein he imprudently relates the whole Transactions of his Voyage, the going off with the Ship, and the Acts of Pyracy he had committed
This was the Substance of the Letter, which, however, did not produce so favourable an Answer as he hoped for, Word being brought back to him, _That he should be fairly hang'd.
_ Whereupon, _Massey_ resolved not to be out of the Way, when he found what important Occasion there was likely to be for him, but takes a Lodging in _Aldersgate-Street_, the next Day went to the Lord Chief Justice's Chambers, and enquired, if my Lord had

On the 5th of _July_ 1723, he was brought to his Tryal, at a Court of Admiralty held at the _Old-Baily_, when Captain _Russel_, Governor _Whitney_'s Son, and others, appeared as Evidences, by whom the Indictment was plainly proved against him; which, if it
Upon the whole, the Captain was found Guilty, received Sentence of Death, and was executed three Weeks after, at _Execution-Dock.
_ We return now to _Lowther_, whom we left cruising off _Hispaniola_, from whence he plyed to Windward, and, near _Porto Rico_, chased two Sail, and spoke with them; they proving to be a small _Bristol_ Ship, commanded by Captain _Smith_, and a _Spanish_
_Lowther_ examined into the _Spaniard_'s Authority for taking an _English_ Vessel, and threat'ned to put every Man of them to death, for so doing; so that the _Spaniards_ fancied themselves to be in a very pittiful Condition, till Matters cleared up, and
After a few Days Cruise, _Lowther_ took a small Sloop belonging to St. _Christophers_, which they mann'd and carried along with them to a small Island, where they cleaned, and stay'd some Time to take their Diversions, which consisted in unheard of
They all got aboard about _Christmas_, observing neither Times nor Seasons, for perpetrating their villainous Actions, and sailed towards the Bay of _Honduras_; but stopping at the _Grand Caimanes_ for Water, they met with a small Vessel with 13 Hands, in
The 10th of _January_, the Pyrates came into the Bay, and fell upon a Ship of 200 Tun, called the _Greyhound, Benjamin Edwards_ Commander, belonging to _Boston.
Lowther_ hoisted his pyratical Colours, and fired a Gun for the _Greyhound_ to bring to, which she refusing, the _Happy Delivery_ (the Name of the Pyrate) edg'd down, and gave her a Broadside, which was returned by Captain _Edwards_ very bravely, and the
The Pyrates Boat came aboard, and not only rifled the Ship, but whipp'd, beat, and cut the Men in a cruel Manner, turned them aboard their own Ship, and then set Fire to their's.
In cruising about the Bay, they met and took several other Vessels without any Resistance, _viz.
_ two Brigantines of _Boston_ in _New-England_, one of which they burnt, and sunk the other; a Sloop belonging to _Connecticut_, Captain _Airs_, which they also burnt; a Sloop of _Jamaica_, Captain _Hamilton_, they took for their own Use; a Sloop of
They took a Sloop of 100 Ton, belonging to _Rhode Island_, which they were pleased to keep, and mount with eight Carriage, and ten Swivel Guns.
With this little Fleet, _viz.
_ Admiral _Lowther_, in the _Happy Delivery_; Captain _Low_, in the _Rhode Island_ Sloop; Captain _Harris_, (who was second Mate in the _Greyhound_ when taken,) in _Hamilton_'s Sloop, and the little Sloop formerly mentioned, serving as a Tender; I say,
_ and fell to work; and at the Time that the Ships were upon the Heel, and the good Folks employ'd in heaving down, scrubing, tallowing, and so forth; of a sudden came down a considerable Body of the Natives, and attack'd the Pyrates unprepared.
As they were in no Condition to defend themselves, they fled to their Sloops, leaving them Masters of the Field and the Spoil thereof, which was of great Value, and set Fire to the _Happy Delivery_, their capital Ship.
_Lowther_ made the best Provision he could in the largest Sloop, which he called the _Ranger_, having ten Guns and eight Swivels, and she sailing best, the Company went all aboard of her, and left the other at Sea.
Provisions was now very short, which, with the late Loss, put them in a confounded ill Humour, insomuch that they were every now and then going together by the Ears, laying the Blame of their ill Conduct sometimes upon one, then upon another.
The Beginning of _May_ 1722, they got to the _West-Indies_, and near the Island of _Diseada_, took a Brigantine, one _Payne_ Master, that afforded them what they stood in need of, which put them in better Temper, and Business seemed to go on well again.
After they had pretty well plundered the Brigantine, they sent her to the Bottom.
They went into the Island and watered, and then stood to the Northward, intending to visit the Main-Coast of _America.
_ In the Latitude of 38, they took a Brigantine called the _Rebecca_ of _Boston_, Captain _Smith_, bound thither from St. _Christophers.
_ At the taking of this Vessel, the Crews divided; for _Low_, whom _Lowther_ joined at the _Grand Caimanes_, proving always a very unruly Member of the Commonwealth, always aspiring, and never satisfy'd with the Proceedings of the Commander; he thought it
_Lowther_ proceeding on his Way to the Main-Coast, took three or four fishing Vessels off _New-York_, which was no great Booty to the Captors.
The 3d of _June_, they met with a small _New-England_ Ship, bound home from _Barbadoes_, which stood an Attack a small Time, but finding it to no Purpose, yielded herself a Prey to the Booters: The Pyrates took out of her fourteen Hogsheads of Rum, six
The next Adventure was not so fortunate for them, for coming pretty near the Coast of _South-Carolina_, they met with a Ship just come out, on her Voyage to _England; Lowther_ gave her a Gun, and hoisted his pyratical Colours; but this Ship, which was
_Lowther_ (not at all pleased with the Compliment, tho' he put up with it for the present) was for taking Leave; but the _Amy_ getting the Pyrate between her and the Shore, stood after him to clap him aboard; to prevent which, _Lowther_ run the Sloop
Captain _Gwatkins_, the Captain of the _Amy_, was obliged to stand off, for fear of running his own Ship ashore; but at the same Time thought fit for the publick Good, to destroy the Enemy; and thereupon went into the Boat, and rowed towards the Sloop, in
After this unfortunate Blow, the Mate returned aboard with the Boat, and not being enclined to pursue them any farther, took Charge of the Ship.
_Lowther_ got off the Sloop after the Departure of the _Amy_, and brought all his Men aboard again, but was in a poor shattered Condition, having suffered much in the Engagement, and had a great many Men kill'd and wounded: He made Shift to get into an
He and his Crew laid up all the Winter, and shifted as well as they could among the Woods, divided themselves into small Parties, and hunted generally in the Day Times, killing of black Cattle, Hogs, _&c.
_ for their Subsistance, and in the Night retired to their Tents and Huts, which they made for Lodging; and sometimes when the Weather grew very cold, they would stay aboard of their Sloop.
In the Spring of the Year 1723, they made Shift to get to Sea, and steered their Course for _Newfoundland_, and upon the Banks took a Scooner, call'd the _Swift, John Hood_ Master; they found a good Quantity of Provisions aboard her, which they very much
They took several other Vessels upon the Banks, and in the Harbour, but none of any great Account; and then steering for a warmer Climate, in _August_ arrived at the _West-Indies.
_ In their Passage thither, they met with a Brigantine, called the _John_ and _Elizabeth, Richard Stanny_ Master, bound for _Boston_, which they plundered, took two of her Men, and discharged her.
_Lowther_ cruised a pretty while among the Islands without any extraordinary Success, and was reduced to a very small Allowance of Provisions, till they had the luck to fall in with a _Martinico_ Man, which proved a seasonable Relief to them; and after
It was now thought necessary to look out for a Place to clean their Sloop in, and prepare for new Adventures: Accordingly the Island of _Blanco_ was pitched upon for that Purpose, which lies in the Latitude of 11° 50 m.
N. about 30 Leagues from the Main of the _Spanish America_, between the Islands of _Margarita_ and _Rocas_, and not far from _Tortuga.
_ It is a low even Island, but healthy and dry, uninhabited, and about two Leagues in Circumference, with Plenty of Lignum Vitæ Trees thereon, growing in Spots, with shrubby Bushes of other Wood about them.
There are, besides Turtle, great Numbers of Guanoes, which is an amphibious Creature like a Lizard, but much larger, the Body of it being as big as a Man's Leg; they are very good to eat, and are much used by the Pyrates that come here: They are of divers
On the N. W. End of this Island, there is a small Cove or sandy Bay, all round the rest of the Island is deep Water, and steep close to the Island.
Here _Lowther_ resorted to, the Beginning of _October_ last, unrigged his Sloop, sent his Guns, Sails, Rigging, _&c.
_ ashore, and put his Vessel upon the Careen.
The _Eagle_ Sloop of _Barbadoes_, belonging to the _South-Sea_ Company, with 35 Hands, commanded by _Walter Moore_, coming near this Island, in her Voyage to _Comena_, on the _Spanish_ Continent, saw the said Sloop just careen'd, with her Guns out, and
The Master of the _Eagle_ got the Pyrate Sloop off, secured her, and went ashore with 25 Hands, in Pursuit of _Lowther_ and his Gang; but after five Day's search, they could find but five of them, which they brought aboard, and then proceeded with the
The _Spanish_ Governor being informed of this brave Action, condemned the Sloop to the Captors, and sent a small Sloop with 23 Hands to scower the Bushes and other Places of the Island of _Blanco_, for the Pyrates that remained there, and took four more,
_ The _Eagle_ Sloop brought all their Prisoners afterwards to St. _Christopher_'s, where the following were try'd by a Court of Vice Admiralty, there held _March_ the 11th, 1722, _viz.
John Churchill, Edward Mackdonald, Nicholas Lewis, Richard West, Sam.
Levercott, Robert White, John Shaw, Andrew Hunter, Jonathan Delve, Matthew Freebarn, Henry Watson, Roger Grange, Ralph Candor_, and _Robert Willis_; the three last were acquitted, the other thirteen were found Guilty, two of which were recommended to Mercy
As for Captain _Lowther_, it is said that he afterwards shot himself upon that fatal Island, where his Pyracies ended, being found, by some Sloop's Men, dead, and a Pistol burst by his Side.

XIII.
OF Captain _Edward Low_, And his CREW.
E_dward Low_ was born in _Westminster_, and had his Education there, such as it was, for he could neither write or read.
Nature seem'd to have designed him for a Pyrate from his Childhood, for very early he began the Trade of plundering, and was wont to raise Contributions among all the Boys of _Westminster_; and if any were bold enough to refuse it, a Battle was the
The Virtues of some of his Family were equal to his; one of his Brothers was a Youth of Genius, when he was but seven Years old, he used to be carried in a Basket, upon a Porter's Back, into a Crowd, and snatch Hats and Wigs: According to the exact
After this, he applied himself to picking of Pockets; when he increased in Strength, he attempted greater Things, such as House-breaking, _&c.
_ But after he had run a short Race, he had the Misfortune of ending his Days at _Tyburn_, in Company with _Stephen Bunce_, and the celebrated _Jack Hall_ the Chimney-Sweeper.
But to return to _Ned_, when he came to Man's Estate, at his eldest Brother's Desire, he went to Sea with him, and so continued for three or four Years, and then parted; and _Ned_ work'd in a Rigging-House in _Boston_ in _New-England_, for a while.
About six Years ago, he took a Trip home to _England_, to see his Mother, who is yet Living.
His Stay was not long here; but taking Leave of his Friends and Acquaintance, for the last Time he should see them; for so he was pleased to say; he returned to _Boston_, and work'd a Year or two longer at the Rigging Business.
But being too apt to disagree with his Masters, he left them, and shipp'd himself in a Sloop that was bound to the Bay of _Honduras.
_ When the Sloop arrived in the Bay, _Ned Low_ was appointed Patron of the Boat, which was employ'd in cutting of Logwood, and bringing it aboard to lade the Ship; for that is the Commodity they make the Voyage for: In the Boat were twelve Men besides
It happened that the Boat one Day came aboard just before Dinner was ready, and _Low_ desired that they might stay and Dine; but the Captain, being in a Hurry for his Lading, ordered them a Bottle of Rum, and to take t'other Trip, because no Time should be
They then proceeded to the Island of the _Grand Caimanes_, intending to have fitted up their small Vessel, and prepare themselves as well as their Circumstances would permit, for their honourable Employment; but falling in Company with _George Lowther_,
We have already given an Account of their joynt Pyracies, under _Lowther_ as chief Commander, till the 28th of _May_, 1722, when they took a Brigantine of _Boston_, bound thither from St. _Christophers_, at which Time they parted, and _Edward Low_ went
Their first Adventure in the Brigantine, was on _Sunday_ the 3d Day of _June_, when they took a Vessel belonging to _Amboy, John Hance_ Master, whom he rifled of his Provisions, and let go; the same Day he met with a Sloop, _James Calquhoon_ Master, off of
_Low_ judged right in making sail from the Coast, for a longer stay had proved fatal to him, for notwithstanding the disabled Condition he had rendered the Sloop in, she made shift to get into _Block Island_, at 12 o'Clock that Night, and immediately
for ten Days; the former had eight Guns and two Swivels, and the latter six Guns, well fitted with small Arms, and in both Sloops 140 stout Fellows; all this was performed with so much Expedition, that before Sun-set, they were under Sail, turning out of
After this Escape, Captain _Low_, went into Port, upon the Coast, for he had not fresh Water enough to run to the Islands, where he staid a few Days, getting Provisions and what Necessaries the Crew wanted, and then sailed for Purchase, (as they call it)
_ About the 12th of _July_, the Brigantine sailed into the Harbour of Port _Rosemary_, and there found thirteen Ships and Vessels, but none of Force, at Anchor, they spread their black Flag, and ran in among them; _Low_ telling them from the Brigantine,
_ a Scooner of 80 Tuns, aboard of which they put 10 Carriage Guns, and 50 Men, and _Low_ himself went Captain, and nam'd her the _Fancy_, making one _Charles Harris_, (who was at first forced into their Service out of the _Greyhound_ of _Boston_, by
_ Some Time after this, they met with two Sloops bound for _Boston_, with Provisions for the Garrison, and the Scooner coming up first, attacked them, but there happening to be an Officer and some Soldiers on Board, who gave them a warm Reception, _Low_
They now steered for the Leeward Islands, but in their Voyage met with such a Hurricane of Wind, that the like had not been known; the Sea ran Mountains high, and seemed to threaten them every Moment with Destruction; it was no Time now to look out for
All Hands were continually employed Night, and Day, on Board the Brigantine, and all little enough, for the Waves went over her, so that they were forced to keep the pump constantly going, besides baling with Buckets; but finding themselves not able to
But to proceed; by their throwing over-board the heavy Goods, the Vessel made considerable less Water, and they could keep it under with the Pump only, which gave them Hopes and new Life; so that instead of cutting all away, they took necessary Measures to
_ and then wore and lay too upon the other Tack, till the Storm was over.
The Scooner made somewhat better Weather of it, of the two, but was pretty roughly handled notwithstanding, having split her Main-sail, sprung her Boltsprit, and cut her Anchors from her Bows.
The Brigantine by running away to Leeward, when she wore upon the Larboard Tack, had lost Sight of the Scooner; but not knowing whether she might be safe or not, as soon as the Wind abated, she set her Main-Sail and Top-Sail, and made short Trips to
After the Storm, _Low_ got safe to a small Island, one of the Weathermost of the _Caribbees_, and there fitted their Vessels, as well as the Place could afford; they got Provisions of the Natives, in exchange for Goods of their own; and as soon as the
The Brigantine sail'd out accordingly, and had not been out many Days before they met a Ship at Sea, that had lost all her Masts; on Board of whom they went, and took from her in Money and Goods, to the Value of 1000 _l.
_ and so left her in the Condition they found her: This Ship was bound home from _Barbadoes_, but losing her Masts in the late Storm, was making for _Antegoa_, to refit, where she afterwards arriv'd.
The Storm just spoken of, was found to have done incredible Damage in those Parts of the World; but however, it appear'd to have been more violent at _Jamaica_, both to the Island and Shipping, there was such a prodigious Swell of the Sea, that several
The Brigantine return'd to the Island, where she had left the Scooner, who being ready to sail, it was put to the Vote of the Company, what Voyage to take next; and herein they follow'd the Advice of the Captain, who thought it not adviseable to go any
The latter End of _July, Low_ took a _French_ Ship of 34 Guns, and carried her along with him to the _Azores.
_ He came into St. _Michael_'s Road the 3d of _August_, and took seven Sail that were lying there, _viz.
_ the _Nostre Dame, Mere de Dieu_, Captain _Roach_ Commander; the _Dove_, Capt.
_Cox_; the _Rose_ Pink, formerly a Man of War, Capt.
_Thompson_; another _English_ Ship, Capt.
_Chandler_; and three other Vessels.
He threatened all with present Death who resisted, which struck such a Terror to them, that they yielded themselves up a Prey to the Villains, without firing a Gun.
The Pyrates being in great Want of Water and fresh Provisions, _Low_ sent to the Governor of St. _Michael_'s for a Supply, and promised upon that Condition to release the Ships he had taken, but otherwise to burn them all; which Demand the Governor thought
_ the _Rose_ Pink, was made a Pyrate Ship, which _Low_ himself took the Command of.
The Pyrates took several of the Guns out of the _French_ Ship, and mounted them aboard the _Rose_, which proved very fit for their Turn, and condemned the former to the Flames.
They took all the Crew out of her, but the Cook, who, they said, being a greazy Fellow would fry well in the Fire; so the poor Man was bound to the Main-Mast, and burnt in the Ship, to the no small Diversion of _Low_ and his _Mirmidons.
_ _Low_ ordered the Scooner to lye in the Fare between St. _Michael_'s and St. _Mary_'s, where, about the 20th of _August_, Captain _Carter_ in the _Wright_ Galley, had the ill Fortune to come in her Way; and because at first they shewed Inclinations to
Another _Portuguese_, who was also Captain _Carter_'s Passenger, putting on a sorrowful Countenance at what he saw acted, one of this vile Crew attacked him upon the Deck, saying, _he did not like his Looks_, and thereupon gave him one Blow a-cross his
At the same Time another of these Rogues cutting at a Prisoner, missed his Mark, and Captain _Low_ standing in his Way, very opportunely received the Stroke upon his under Jaw, which laid the Teeth bare; upon this the Surgeon was called, who immediately
When they had plundered Captain _Carter_'s Ship, several of them were for burning her, as they had done the _French_ Man, but it was otherwise resolved at last; for after they had cut her Cables, Rigging and Sails to Pieces, they left her to the Mercy of
After these Depredations, they steered for the Island of _Madera_, where missing other Booty, they took up with a Fishing-Boat, with two old Men and a Boy in her, one of which they detained on Board, but sent the other ashore with a Flag of Truce,
From this Island they sailed to the _Canaries_, but meeting with no Prey there, they continued their Course for the _Cape de Verd_ Islands, and at _Bonavista_, took a Ship called the _Liverpool Merchant_, Captain _Goulding_, from whom they stole a great
_ The Pyrate also took among these Islands, a Ship belonging to _Liverpool, Scot_ Commander; two _Portuguese_ Sloops bound for _Brasil_; a small _English_ Sloop trading there, _James Pease_ Master, bound to _Sancta Crux_, and three Sloops from St. _Thomas_
_Low_ had heard by one of the above mentioned Ships, that two small Gallies were expected every Day at the _Western Islands, viz.
_ the _Greyhound_, Captain _Glass_, and the _Joliff_, Captain _Aram_; the former of which was designed to be fitted for the pyratical Trade to _Brasil_, if Things had happened to their Minds.
They mann'd the Sloop, and sent her in Quest of one or both of these Ships to the _Western Islands_ aforesaid, whilst they carreen'd their Ship _Rose_, at one of the _Cape de Verds_: But now Fortune that had hitherto been so propitious to them, left her
_Low_, in the mean Time, did not fare quite so ill, but had his intended Voyage to _Brasil_ spoil'd, by the oversetting of his Ship, when she was upon the Careen, whereby she was lost, so that he was reduc'd to his old Scooner, which he called the _Fancy_,
_ They proceeded now to the _West-Indies_, but before they had gotten far on their Voyage, they attack'd a rich _Portuguese_ Ship, call'd the _Nostre Signiora de Victoria_, bound home from _Bahia_, and after some Resistance, took her.
_Low_ tortur'd several of the Men, to make them declare where the Money, (which he suppos'd they had on Board) lay, and extorted by that Means, a Confession that the Captain had, during the Chace, hung out of the Cabin Window, a Bag with 11,000 Moidores,
_Low_, upon hearing what a Prize had escap'd him, rav'd like a Fury, swore a thousand Oaths, and ordered the Captain's Lips to be cut off, which he broil'd before his Face, and afterwards murthered him and all the Crew, being thirty two Persons.
After this bloody Action, they continued their Course, till they came to the Northward of all the Islands, and there cruiz'd for about a Month, in which Time they made Prizes of the following Vessels, _viz.
_ a Snow from _New-York_ to _Curacoa, Robert Leonard_ Master; a Sloop from the Bay, bound to _New-York, Craig_ Master; a Snow from _London_ and _Jamaica_, bound to _New-York_; and the _Stanhope_ Pink, _Andrew Delbridge_ Master, from _Jamaica_ to _Boston_;
After this Cruize, they went into one of the Islands and clean'd, and then steered for the Bay of _Honduras_, where they arrived about the Middle of _March_ 1722-3, and met a Sloop turning out of the said Bay.
The Pyrates had hoisted up _Spanish_ Colours, and continued them till they drew near the Sloop, then they hall'd them down, hoisted their black Flag, fired a Broadside, and boarded her.
This Sloop was a _Spaniard_ of six Guns, and 70 Men, that came into the Bay that Morning, and meeting there with five _English_ Sloops, and a Pink, made Prizes of them all, plundered them, and brought the Masters of the Vessels away Prisoners, for the
_ The _Spaniards_ made no Resistance, so that the _English_ Pyrates soon became their Masters and fell to rifling; but finding the above-mentioned People in the Hold, and several _English_ Goods, they consulted _Low_ the Captain thereupon, and without
Some of the miserable Creatures jump'd down into the Hold, but could not avoid the Massacre; they met Death every where, for if they escaped it from one Hand, they were sure to perish by another; the only Prospect they had of Life, was to fly from the Rage
'Twas thought the rest did not long survive their miserable Condition, and could only prolong their Lives, to add to the Misery of them.
When the murdering Work was over, they rumaged the _Spanish_ Pyrate, and brought all the Booty aboard their own Vessels: The six Masters aforementioned, found in the Hold, they restored to their respective Vessels: They forced away the Carpenter from the
_Low_ set the Masters of the Vessels free, but would not suffer them to steer for _Jamaica_, where they were then bound, for fear the Men of War should get Intelligence of them, but forced them all to go to _New-York_, threat'ning them with Death, when
In the next Cruize, which was between the Leeward Islands and the Main, they took two Snows, bound from _Jamaica_ to _Liverpool_, and a Snow from _Jamaica_ to _London, Bridds_ Master; as also a Ship from _Biddford_ to _Jamaica, John Pinkham_ Commander; and
_ On the 27th of _May, Low_ and his Consort _Harris_, came off _South-Carolina_, and met with three good Ships, _viz.
_ the _Crown_, Captain _Lovereigne_, the _King William_, the _Carteret_, and a Brigantine, who all came out of _Carolina_ together two Days before.
The Pyrates were at the Trouble of chacing them, and Captain _Lovereigne_ being the sternmost, she fell first a Prey into their Hands; and they spent all the Day in coming up with the rest.
Within a few Days they took a Ship called the _Amsterdam Merchant_, Captain _Willard_, from _Jamaica_, but belonging to _New-England_; as _Low_ let none of that Country depart without some Marks of his Rage, he cut off this Gentleman's Ears, slit up his
After this he took a Sloop bound to _Amboy, William Frazier_, Master, with whom Mr. _Low_ happening to be displeased, he ordered lighted Matches to be ty'd between the Mens Fingers, which burnt all the Flesh off the Bones; then cut them in several Parts of
The _Kingston_, Captain _Estwick_, another Ship, one _Burrington_ Master, two Brigantines from _Carolina_ to _London_; a Sloop from _Virginia_ to _Bermudas_; a Ship from _Glasgow_ to _Virginia_; a Scooner from _New-York_ to _South-Carolina_; a Pink from
It happened that at this Time one of his Majesty's Ships was upon a Cruize, on this Station, and got Intelligence of some of the mischievous Actions of this Miscreant, by one of the Vessels that had been plundered by him, who steering as directed, came in
The Rovers looking out for Prey, soon saw, and gave Chace to the Man of War, which was called the _Greyhound_, a Ship of 20 Guns, and 120 Men, rather inferiour in Force to the two Pyrate Vessels: The _Greyhound_ finding them so eager, was in no doubt what
When the _Greyhound_ came within Musquet-shot, she halled up her Main-sail, and clapp'd close upon a Wind, to keep the Pyrates from running to Leeward, and then engaged: But when the Rogues found who they had to deal with, they edg'd away under the Man of
The Pyrates haul'd upon a Wind to receive the Man of War, and the Fight was immediately renewed, with a brisk Fire on both Sides, till the _Ranger_'s Main-Yard was shot down, and the _Greyhound_ pressing close upon the disabled Sloop, _Low_, in the other,
The Conduct of _Low_ was surprizing in this Adventure, because his reputed Courage and Boldness, had, hitherto, so possess'd the Minds of all People, that he became a Terror, even to his own Men; but his Behaviour throughout this whole Action, shewed him
The _Greyhound_ carried in their Prize to _Rhode Island_, to the great Joy of the whole Province, tho' it had been more compleat, if the great _LOW_ himself had grac'd the Triumph.
The Prisoners were strongly secured in a Goal, till a Court of Vice-Admiralty could be held for their Tryals, which begun on the 10th of _July_, at _Newport_, and continued three Days.
The Court was made up of the following Gentlemen.

But alass they were dead to all Goodness, and had not so much as one Spark of Virtue to stir them up to be thankful for such an eminent Deliverance: But instead thereof, vented a Million of Oaths and Curses upon the Captain of the _Greyhound_, vowing to
The first Prey that they met with, after their Flight, was a small Sloop belonging to _Nantucket_, a Whale-Fishing, about 80 Miles from Land; the Master of which, one _Nathan Skiff_, a brisk young Fellow, the Pyrates cruelly whipp'd naked about the Deck,
There was another Whale-Boat belonging to this Sloop last mentioned, which happened to be at some Distance from her, and perceiving what was doing, rowed with all speed to another Sloop not far off, to acquaint her with the Misfortune, that the Men might
Some Days after, _Low_ took a Fishing-Boat off of _Block Island_, but did not perpetrate so much Cruelty to her, contenting himself with only cutting off the Master's Head: But after taking two Whale-Boats near _Rhode Island_, he caused one of the Master's
Several other Persons he would have murthered, but Humanity prevailing in the tender Hearts of his Companions, they refused to put his savage Orders in Execution.
From the Coast of _New-England, Low_ sailed directly for _Newfoundland_, and, near Cape _Briton_, took two or three and twenty _French_ Vessels; and one of them of 22 Guns he mann'd with Pyrates, making a sort of a Man of War of her; with which he scower'd
Thus these inhumane Wretches went on, who could not be contented to satisfy their Avarice only, and travel in the common Road of Wickedness; but, like their Patron, the Devil, must make Mischief their Sport, Cruelty their Delight, and damning of Souls
Of all the pyratical Crews that were ever heard of, none of the _English_ Name came up to this, in Barbarity; their Mirth and their Anger had much the same Effect, for both were usually gratified with the Cries and Groans of their Prisoners; so that they
An Instance of this had liked to have happened to one Captain _Graves_, Master of a _Virginia_ Ship last taken; for as soon as he came aboard of the Pyrate, _Low_ takes a Bowl of Punch in his Hand, and drinks to him, saying, _Captain_ Graves, _here's half

The latter End of _July_, (1723,) _Low_ took a large Ship, called the _Merry Christmas_, and fitted her for a Pyrate, cut several Ports in her, and mounted her with 34 Guns.
_Low_ goes aboard of this Ship, assumes the Title of Admiral, and hoists a black Flag, with the Figure of Death in red, at the Main-topmast Head, and takes another Voyage to the _Western Islands_, where he arrived the Beginning of _September.
_ The first Vessel he met with there, was a Brigantine, formerly an _English_ Sloop, commanded by _Elias Wild_, but lately bought by a _Portuguese_ Nobleman, and altered: She was manned partly with _English_, and partly _Portuguese_; the latter _Low_
At St. _Michaels_, they sent in their Boats and cut out of the Road, a new _London_ built Ship of 14 Guns, commanded by Captain _Thompson_, who was taken there the Year before, by _Low_, in the _Rose_ Pink.
The Boats had fewer Men than the Ship, and Captain _Thompson_ would have defended himself, but his Men through Cowardize, or too great an Inclination of becoming Pyrates themselves, refused to stand by him, and he was obliged to surrender; and when he came
The next was a _Portuguese_ Bark that fell into their Hands, whose Men came off somewhat better than usual, for they only cut them with their Cutlashes, out of Wantonness, turned them all into their Boat, and set their Vessel on Fire.
When the Boat was going from the Side of the Ship, one of _Low_'s Men, who, we may suppose, was forced into his Gang, was drinking with a Silver Tankard at one of the Ports, and took his Opportunity to drop into the Boat among the _Portuguese_, and lye

_JOHN EVANS_, And his CREW.
J_OHN Evans_ was a _Welch_ Man, had been formerly Master of a Sloop belonging to _Nevis_, but losing his Employ there, he sailed for some Time out of _Jamaica_ as Mate, till happening in Company of three or four of his Comrades, and Wages not being so good
They sailed, or rather rowed out of _Port Royal_ in _Jamaica_, the latter End of _September_ 1722, in a Canoa; and coming on the North-Side of the Island, went ashore in the Night, broke open a House or two, and robb'd them of some Money, and every Thing
This was very well for the first Time, but this kind of Robbery did not please so well, they wanted to get out to Sea, but having no Vessel but their Canoa, they were prevented in their laudable Design; however, they kept a good look out, and traversed the
After they had put their Affairs in a proper Disposition aboard, they went ashore to a little Village for Refreshments, and lived jovially the remaining Part of the Day, at a Tavern, spending three Pistols, and then departed.
The People of the House admired at the merry Guests they had got, were mightily pleased, and wished for their Company at another Time, which happened too soon for their Profit; for, in the middle of the Night, they came ashore all Hands, rifled the House,
The next Day they weighed in the Sloop, aboard of which they mounted four Guns, called her the _Scowerer_, and sailed to _Hispaniola_; on the North Part of which Island they took a _Spanish_ Sloop, which proved an extraordinary rich Prize, as it fell among
_ a Man.
In Pursuance of the Game, and beating up for the Windward Islands, the _Scowerer_ met with a Ship from _New-England_, bound to _Jamaica_, 120 Tons, called the _Dove_, Captain _Diamond_ Master, off _Porto Rico_: They plundered her, and strengthened their
The next Prize they made, was the _Lucretia and Catherine_, Captain _Mills_, of 200 Ton Burthen; they came up with her near the Island _Disseada, January_ 11th.
Upon seizing of this Ship, the Pyrates began to take upon themselves the Distribution of Justice, examining the Men concerning their Master's Usage of them, according to the Custom of other Pyrates; but the Captain over-hearing the Matter, put an End to

_ After the taking of this Prize, they went to the little Island of _Avis_, with a Design to clean, and carried the _Lucretia_ along with them, in order to heave down the _Scowerer_ by her; but meeting there with a Sloop, the Pyrate gave Chace till the
This Chace brought them to Leeward of their Port, so that they were obliged to look out for another Place of Retreat, and the Island of _Ruby_ not being far distant, they steered for that, and anchored there accordingly; but the next Day a _Dutch_ Sloop
They found this Sloop more for their Purpose than the _Lucretia_, to clean their own Sloop by, as being much lower in the Wast, and therefore capable of heaving her Bottom farther out of the Water, so she was discharged, and the _Dutch_ Man kept in her
The Boatswain of the Pyrate being a noisy surly Fellow, the Captain had at several Times Words with him, relating to his Behaviour, who thinking himself ill treated, not only returned ill Language, but also challenged the Captain to fight him on the next
When the Sloop arrived, as abovementioned, the Captain proposed the Duel; but the cowardly Boatswain refused to fight, or go ashore, tho' it was his own Challenge.
When Captain _Evans_ saw there was nothing to be done with him, he took his Cane, and gave him a hearty drubbing; but the Boatswain not being able to bear such an Indignity, drew out a Pistol and shot _Evans_ thro' the Head, so that he fell down dead; and
The Death of the Captain in that Manner, provoked all the Crew, and they resolved the Criminal should die by the most exquisite Tortures; but while they were considering of the Punishment, the Gunner, transported with Passion, discharged a Pistol, and shot

OF Captain _John Phillips_, And his CREW.
J_OHN Phillips_ was bred a Carpenter, and sailing to _Newfoundland_ in a West-Country Ship, was taken by _Anstis_ in the _Good Fortune_ Brigantine, the next Day after he had left his Consort and Commadore, Captain _Roberts.
Phillips_ was soon reconciled to the Life of a Pyrate, and being a brisk Fellow, was appointed Carpenter of the Vessel, for at first his Ambition reach'd no higher; there he remain'd till they broke up at _Tabago_, and was one of those who came home in a
His Stay was not long in _England_, for whilst he was paying his first Visits to his Friends in _Devonshire_, he heard of the Misfortune of some of his Companions, that is, of their being taken and committed to _Bristol_ Goal; and there being good Reason
When the Ship came to _Peter_ Harbour in _Newfoundland_ aforesaid, he ran away from her, and hired himself a Splitter in the Fishery, for the Season: But this was only till he could have an Opportunity of prosecuting his intended Rogueries; in order to

The first Thing they had now to do, was to chuse Officers, draw up Articles, and settle their little Commonwealth, to prevent Disputes and Ranglings afterwards; so _John Phillips_ was made Captain, _John Nutt_, Master, (or Navigator) of the Vessel; _James
The Articles on Board the _Revenge.
_ 1.
E_Very Man shall obey civil Command; the Captain shall have one full Share and a half in all Prizes; the Master, Carpenter, Boatswain and Gunner shall have one Share and quarter.
_ 2.
_If any Man shall offer to run away, or keep any Secret from the Company, he shall be marroon'd, with one Bottle of Powder, one Bottle of Water, one small Arm, and Shot.
_ 3.
_If any Man shall steal any Thing in the Company, or game, to the Value of a Piece of Eight, he shall be marroon'd or shot.
_ 4.
_If at any Time we should meet another Marrooner_ [_that is, _Pyrate,] _that Man that shall sign his Articles without the Consent of our company, shall suffer such Punishment as the Captain and Company shall think fit.
_ 5.
_That Man that shall strike another whilst these Articles are in force, shall receive_ Moses_'s Law_ (_that is_, 40 _Stripes lacking one_) _on the bare Back.
_ 6.
_That Man that shall snap his Arms, or smoak Tobacco in the Hold, without a Cap to his Pipe, or carry a Candle lighted without a Lanthorn, shall suffer the same Punishment as in the former Article.
_ 7.
_That Man that shall not keep his Arms clean, fit for an Engagement, or neglect his Business, shall be cut off from his Share, and suffer such other Punishment as the Captain and the Company shall think fit.
_ 8.
_If any Man shall lose a Joint in time of an Engagement, shall have_ 400 _Pieces of Eight; if a Limb_, 800.
9.
_If at any time you meet with a prudent Woman, that Man that offers to meddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer present Death.
_ Thus prepar'd, this bold Crew set out, and before they left the Banks they made Prize of several small Fishing-Vessels, out of which they got a few Hands, some _French_ and some _English_, and then sail'd for the _West-Indies_; in one of these Vessels
The Pyrates came off _Barbadoes_ the beginning of _October_, and cruised there, and among other Islands, above three Months, without speaking with a Vessel, so that they were almost starv'd for want of Provisions, being reduc'd to a Pound of Meat a Day
This proved a seasonable Supply; they took her Provisions, and four of her Men, and let her go.
They took presently after, a Sloop belonging to _New-York_, and a _Virginia_ Man, _Huffam_ Master.
Having now occasion to clean their Vessel, _Phillips_ propos'd _Tobago_, where the Company he formerly belong'd to, under _Anstis_ and _Fenn_, broke up; to induce them to it, he told them when he left the Island, there was left behind six or eight of their
They took _Pedro_ on Board, and then fell to Business, careening their Vessel; and just as they had finished their Work, a Man of War's Boat came into the Harbour, the Ship being cruising to Leeward of the Island.
It was easily guess'd upon what Errant she was sent, and therefore they lost no Time, but, as soon as the Boat went away, warp'd out, and ply'd to Windward for Security, but left the four _French_ Men, they took out of the _Martinico_ Sloop, behind.
In a few Days they took a Snow with a few Hands, and _Fern_, the Carpenter, one _William Phillips, Wood_ and _Taylor_, went aboard to take Possession of her.
_Fern_, not forgetting the Affront of having _Archer_ preferr'd before him, resolv'd to go off with the Prize, and brought the rest into the same Measures; however _Phillips_, the Captain, keeping a good Look-out, perceiv'd their Design, and gave them
There was no Surgeon aboard, and therefore it was advis'd, upon a learned Consultation, that _Phillips_'s Leg should be cut off; but who should perform the Operation was the Dispute; at length the Carpenter was appointed, as the most proper Man: Upon
From _Tobago_ they stood away to the Northward and took a _Portugueze_ bound for _Brazil_, and two or three Sloops from _Jamaica_, in one of which, _Fern_ the Carpenter, endeavouring to go off, was kill'd by _Phillips_ the Captain, pursuant to their
These Severities made it dangerous for any to consult or project an Escape; the Terror of which made several sign their Articles and set down quietly, waiting impatiently for Redemption, which as yet they saw no great likelyhood of, and should they have
Thus was many an honest Man's Case made most desperate by the consummate Villany of a few hardned Wretches, who fear neither God or Devil, as this _Phillips_ us'd often blasphemously to express himself.
On the 25th of _March_ they took two Ships from _Virginia_ for _London, John Phillips_, the Pyrate Captain's Namesake, was Master of one, and Captain _Robert Mortimer_, the other, a brisk young Fellow, that deserv'd a better Fate than he met with.
_Phillips_ the Pyrate staid on Board of Captain _Mortimer_'s Ship, while they transported the Crew to the Sloop, and the Boat returning along side, one of the Pyrates therein calls to _Phillips_, and tells him, there was a Mutiny aboard their Vessel,
This was the first Voyage that _Mortimer_ had the Command of a Vessel, by whose Death is a poor disconsolate Widow made miserable, more in regard of the mutual Love and Fidelity they lived in, than the Loss of what would have been a handsome and
This Affair ended without any other Consequence than a strict Search after a Brother of Captain _Mortimer_, who was on Board, in order to have put him likewise to death; but he had the good Fortune to meet with a Townsman among the Crew, who hid him for
Out of the other _Virginia_ Man before spoken of, they took one _Edward Cheeseman_, a Carpenter, to supply the Place of their late Carpenter, _Fern.
_ He was a modest sober young Man, very averse to their unlawful Practice, and a brave gallant Fellow.
There was one _John Philmore_ of _Ipswich_, formerly taken by them, ordered to row _Cheeseman_ aboard of _Mortimer_'s Ship, which the Pyrates possess'd themselves of, who, seeing with what Reluctance and Uneasiness _Cheeseman_ was brought away, told him,
But, however specious this seemed, _Cheeseman_ out of Prudence rejected his Offers of Assistance, till he saw some Proofs of his Sincerity, which after a few Days he was convinced of, and then they often consulted; but as the old Pyrates were always
The Pyrates went on all the while, plundering and robbing several Ships and Vessels, bending their Course towards _Newfoundland_, where they designed to raise more Men, and do all the Mischief they could on the Banks, and in the Harbours.
_Newfoundland_ is an Island on the North Continent of _America_, contained between the 46 and 53° of N. Latitude, discovered first by St. _Sebastion Cabot_ A. D. 1497, but never settled till the Year 1610; when Mr. _Guy_ of _Bristol_ revived the Affair,
The Island is deserted by the Natives and neglected by us, being desolate and Woody, and the Coast and Harbour only held for the Conveniency of the Cod Fishery, for which alone they were settled.
The Bays and Harbours about it, are very numerous and convenient, and being deeply indented, makes it easy for any Intelligence quickly to pass from one Harbour to another over Land; especially the principal, St. _John_'s and _Placentia_, when the
They are able to cure and export about 100000 Quintals (100 Weight each) of Fish, annually, which returns to _England_ in Money, or the necessary Commodities of _Portugal, Spain_ and _Italy.
_ As it therefore expends abundance of Rum, Molossus and Sugar, the Product of our _West-India_ Colonies, and employs a Number of Fishermen from home every Season, by whose Industry and Labour only this Fish is purchased, it may very well be reckon'd an
But the present Design of this Digression being not to give an exact Description of the Country or Fishery; but rather how it accidentally contributes to raise, or support the Pyrates already rais'd, I shall observe, First, That our West Country

_ When the _Newfoundland_ Ships left that Country, towards Winter, in the Year 1720, these Passengers muster'd 1100, who, during the Season of Business, (the Hardness of their Labour, and Chilness of the Nights, pinching them very much) are mostly fond of
The Masters residing there think Advantages taken on their Necessities, no more than a just and lawful Gain; and either bind such for the next Summer's Service, or sell their Provisions out to them at extravagant Rates; Bread from 15s.
to 50, immediately at the departing of the Ships, and so of other sorts of Food in Proportion; wherefore not being able to subsist themselves, or in any likely Way of clearing the Reckoning to the Masters, they sometimes run away with Shallops and Boats,
And secondly (which is more opportunely for them,) they are visited every Summer, almost, by some Set of Pyrates or other, already rais'd, who call here for the same Purpose, (if young Beginners) and to lay in a Store of Water and Provisions, which they
Towards this Country _Phillips_ was making his Way, and took on the Voyage, besides those abovementioned, one _Salter_, in a Sloop off the Isle of _Sables_, which Vessel they made use of themselves, and gave back _Mortimer_'s Ship to the Mate and Crew.
The same Day, _viz.
_ the 4th of _April_, took a Scooner, one _Chadwell_, Master, which they scuttled, in order to sink; but Capt.
_Phillips_ understanding that she belong'd to Mr. _Minors_ at _Newfoundland_, with whose Vessel they first went off a pyrating, a Qualm of Conscience came athwart his Stomach, and he said to his Companions, _We have done him Injury enough already_; so
That Afternoon they chac'd another Vessel, and at Night came up with her, the Master of which was a Saint of _New-England_, nam'd _Dependance Ellery_, who taking _Phillips_ for a Pyrate, he told him was the Reason that he gave him the Trouble of chacing so
Within few Days several other Vessels had the same Misfortune, the Masters Names were as follow, _Joshua Elwell, Samuel Elwell_, Mr. _Combs_, Mr. _Lansly, James Babston, Edward Freeman_, Mr. _Start, Obediah Beal, Erick Erickson_ and _Benjamin Wheeler.
_ The 14th of _April_ they took a Sloop belonging to Cape _Ann, Andrew Harradine_ Master; they look'd upon this Vessel more fit for their Purpose, and so came aboard, keeping only the Master of her Prisoner, and sending _Harradine_'s Crew away in
To this _Harradine, Cheeseman_ the Carpenter, broke his Mind, and brought him into the Confederacy to destroy the Crew, which was put in Execution four Days afterwards.
_Harradine_ and the rest were for doing the Business in the Night, as believing they might be more opportunely surpriz'd; for _Nut_, the Master, being a Fellow of great Strength, and no less Courage, it was thought dangerous to attack him without
In the mean while _Filemore_ takes up the Axe, and turns it round upon the Point, as if at Play, then both he and _Harradine_ wink at him, thereby letting him know they were ready; upon which Signal he seizes _Nut_ by the Collar, with one Hand between his
what are you going to do, Carpenter?
_ He told him it was an unnecessary Question, _For_, says he, _Master, you are a dead Man_, so strikes him over the Arm, _Nut_ looses his Hold, tumbles into the Sea, and never spoke more.
By this time the Boatswain was dead; for as soon as _Filemore_ saw the Master laid hold of, he raised up the Axe, and divided his Enemy's Head in two: The Noise brought the Captain upon Deck, whom _Cheeseman_ saluted with the Blow of a Mallet, which broke
The Work being done, they went about Ship, altered the Course from _Newfoundland_ to _Boston_, and arrived safe the 3d of _May_ following, to the great Joy of that Province.
On the 12th of _May_, 1724, a special Court of Admiralty was held for the Tryal of these Pyrates, when _John Filmore, Edward Cheeseman, John Combs, Henry Giles, Charles Ivymay, John Bootman_, and _Henry Payne_, the seven that confederated together for the

The two former were executed on the 2d of _June_, and dy'd very penitently, making the following Declarations at the Place of Execution, with the Assistance of two grave Divines that attended them.
_The dying Declarations of_ John Rose Archer _and_ William White, _on the Day of their Execution at_ Boston, June 2, 1724, _for the Crimes of Pyracy.
_ First, separately, of _Archer.
_ I Greatly bewail my Profanations of the Lord's Day, and my Disobedience to my Parents.
And my Cursing and Swearing, and my blaspheming the Name of the glorious God.
Unto which I have added, the Sins of Unchastity.
And I have provoked the Holy One, at length, to leave me unto the Crimes of Pyracy and Robbery; wherein, at last, I have brought my self under the Guilt of Murder also.
But one Wickedness that has led me as much as any, to all the rest, has been my brutish Drunkenness.
By strong Drink I have been heated and hardened into the Crimes that are now more bitter than Death unto me.
I could wish that Masters of Vessels would not use their Men with so much Severity, as many of them do, which exposes to great Temptations.
And then of _White.
_ I am now, with Sorrow, reaping the Fruits of my Disobedience to my Parents, who used their Endeavours to have me instructed in my Bible, and my Catechism.
And the Fruits of my neglecting the publick Worship of God, and prophaning the holy Sabbath.
And of my blaspheming the Name of God, my Maker.
But my Drunkenness has had a great Hand in bringing my Ruin upon me.
I was drunk when I was enticed aboard the Pyrate.
And now, for all the vile Things I did aboard, I own the Justice of God and Man, in what is done unto me.
Of both together.
We hope, we truly hate the Sins, whereof we have the Burthen lying so heavy upon our Consciences.
We warn all People, and particularly young People, against such Sins as these.
We wish, all may take Warning by us.
We beg for Pardon, for the sake of Christ, our Saviour; and our Hope is in him alone.
Oh!
_that in his Blood our Scarlet and Crimson Guilt may be all washed away!
_ We are sensible of an hard Heart in us, full of Wickedness.
And we look upon God for his renewing Grace upon us.
We bless God for the Space of Repentance which he has given us; and that he has not cut us off in the Midst and Heighth of our Wickedness.
We are not without Hope, that God has been savingly at work upon our Souls.
We are made sensible of our absolute Need of the Righteousness of Christ; that we may stand justified before God in that.
We renounce all Dependance on our own.
We are humbly thankful to the Ministers of Christ, for the great Pains they have taken for our Good.
The Lord Reward their Kindness.
We don't Despair of Mercy; but hope, through Christ, that when we dye, we shall find Mercy with God, and be received into his Kingdom.
We wish others, and especially the Sea-faring, may get Good by what they see this Day befalling of us.

OF Captain _SPRIGGS_, And his CREW.
S_Priggs_ sailed with _Low_ for a pretty while, and I believe came away from _Lowther_, along with him; he was Quarter-Master to the Company, and consequently had a great Share in all the Barbarities committed by that execrable Gang, till the Time they
Spriggs_ took Possession of the Ship with eighteen Men, left _Low_ in the Night, and came to the _West-Indies.
_ This Separation was occasioned by a Quarrel with _Low_, concerning a Piece of Justice _Spriggs_ would have executed upon one of the Crew, for killing a Man in cold Blood, as they call it, one insisting that he should be hang'd, and the other that he
A Day or two after they parted, _Spriggs_ was chose Captain by the rest, and a black Ensign was made, which they called _Jolly Roger_, with the same Device that Captain _Low_ carried, _viz.
_ a white Skeliton in the Middle of it, with a Dart in one Hand striking a bleeding Heart, and in the other, an Hour-Glass; when this was finished and hoisted, they fired all their Guns to salute their Captain and themselves, and then looked out for Prey.
In their Voyage to the _West-Indies_, these Pyrates took a _Portuguese_ Bark, wherein they got valuable Plunder, but not contented with that alone, they said they would have a little Game with the Men, and so ordered them a Sweat, more for the Brutes
_ and as he runs round and round, the Musick playing at the same Time, they prick him with those Instuments; this usually lasts for 10 or 12 Minutes, which is as long as the miserable Man can support himself.
When the Sweating was over, they gave the _Portuguese_ their Boat with a small Quantity of Provisions, and set their Vessel on Fire.
Near the Island of St. _Lucia_, they took a Sloop belonging to _Barbadoes_, which they plundered, and then burnt, forcing some of the Men to sign their Articles, the others they beat and cut in a barbarous Manner, because they refused to take on with the
_ The next was a _Martinico_ Man, which they served as bad as they had done the others, but did not burn their Ship.
Some Days afterwards in running down to Leeward, they took one Captain _Hawkins_, coming from _Jamaica_, loaden chiefly with Logwood; they took out of her, Stores, Arms, Ammunition, and several other Things, as they thought fit, and what they did not want
They took by Force, out of her, Mr. _Burridge_ and Mr. _Stephens_, the two Mates, and some other Hands; and after detaining the Ship from the 22d of _March_, to the 29th, they let her go.
On the 27th they took a _Rhode Island_ Sloop, Captain _Pike_, and all his Men were obliged to go aboard the Pyrate; but the Mate being a grave sober Man, and not inclinable to stay, they told him, he should have his Discharge, and that it should be
The next Day Mr. _Burridge_, Captain _Hawkins_'s Mate, sign'd their Articles, which was so agreeable to them (he being a good Artist and Sailor) that they gave three Huzza's, fir'd all the Guns in the Ship, and appointed him Master: The Day was spent in

This was such a Baulk to them, that they resolved he should suffer for falling in their Way, tho' it was so contrary to his own Inclinations: About 15 of them surrounded the poor Man with sharp Cutlashes, and fell upon him, whereby he was soon laid flat on
They were now most of 'em drunk, as is usual at this Time of Night, so they unanimously agreed to make a Bonfire of _Hawkins_'s Ship, which was immediately done, and in half an Hour she was all of a Blaze.
After this, they wanted a little more Diversion, and so Captain _Hawkins_ was sent for down to the Cabin to Supper; what should the Provision be, but a Dish of Candles, which he was forced to eat, having a naked Sword and a Pistol held to his Breast all
Two Days afterwards, they anchor'd at a little uninhabited Island, call'd _Rattan_, near the Bay of _Honduras_, and put ashore Captain _Hawkins_, and several other Men, (one of them his Passenger) who dy'd there of the Hardships he underwent.
They gave them Powder and Ball, and a Musquet, with which they were to shift as they could, sailing away the next Day for other Adventures.
Captain _Hawkins_, and his unfortunate Companions, staid 19 Days upon this Island, supplying themselves with both Fish and Fowl, such as they were, at which Time came two Men in a Canoe, that had been left upon another marroon Island near _Benacca_, who

_ At an Island to the Westward, the Pyrates clean'd their Ship, and sail'd towards the Island of St. _Christophers_, to wait for one Captain _Moor_, who commanded the _Eagle_ Sloop, when she took _Lowther_'s upon the Careen, at _Blanco_; _Spriggs_ resolved
_Spriggs_ then stood to the Northward, towards _Burmudas_, or the _Summer Isles_, and took a Scooner belonging to _Boston_; he took out all the Men and sunk the Vessel, and had the Impudence to tell the Master, that he designed to encrease his Company on
The Pyrate ask'd the Master if he knew Captain _Solgard_, who answering No; he ask'd another the same Question, and then a third, who said he knew him very well, upon which _Spriggs_ ordered him to be sweated, which was done in the Manner before describ'd.
Instead of going to _Newfoundland_ as the Pyrates threat'ned, they came back to the Islands, and to Windward of St. _Christophers_, on the 4th of _June_ last, took a Sloop, _Nicholas Trot_ Master, belonging to St. _Eustatia_, and wanting a little
Within two or three Days they took a Ship coming from _Rhode-Island_ to St. _Christophers_, loaden with Provisions and some Horses; the Pyrates mounted the Horses and rid them about the Deck backwards and forwards a full Gallop, like Madmen at
This is the last Account we have had of Captain _Spriggs_, I shall only add the two following Relations, and conclude.
A Brigantine belonging to _Bristol_, one _Mr. Rowry_ Master, had been trading at _Gambia_, in _Africa_, and falling as low as Cape _Mount_, to finish the slaving of the Vessel, he had, by a Misfortune usual at that Part of the Coast, his Mate, Surgeon, and
The Remainder of his Company, which was not above 5 or 6 in Number, took this Opportunity, and seiz'd the Vessel in the Road, making the Master Prisoner.
You will think it prodigious impudent that so small a Number should undertake to proceed a pyrating, especially when neither of them had sufficient Skill in Navigation: Yet this they did, leaving those People, their Ship-Mates abovemention'd, to the Mercy
e.
_ would carry as much Terror; and that they did not doubt of soon increasing their Crew, to put them in an enterprizing Capacity; but their vain Projection was soon happily frustrated, and after this Manner.
The Master whose Life they had preserved, (perhaps only for supplying their own Unskillfulness in Navigation,) advised them, that since contrary to their Expectations, they had met with no Ship between _Cape Mount_, and the _Bite_ of _Calabar_, to proceed
They arrived there in _August_ 1721, and one Evening, while Part of them were on Shore, applying for this Purpose to the Governor, and the other Part carelesly from the Deck, Mr. _Rowry_ stepp'd into the Boat belonging to the Vessel, and pushed off, very
The _Swallow_ arrived at St. _Thomas_'s the Beginning of _October_ following, where, on Mr. _Rowry_'s Remonstrance, Application was made to the _Portuguese_ Governor of that Island, for a Surrendery of these five _English_ Prisoners then in the Castle; but
The manner of Denial, and the avaritious Temper of the Gentleman, which I had Occasion to be acquainted with, makes it very suspicious, that he proposed considerable Gains to himself; for if Mr. _Rowry_ had not made such an Escape to him, the Slaves had
But enough of this; perhaps he is not the only Governor abroad that finds an Interest in countenancing these Fellows.

] An Account of the Pyracies and Murders committed by _Philip Roche_, _&c.
_ P_Hilip Roche_ was born in _Ireland_, and from his Youth had been bred up to the Sea; he was a brisk genteel Fellow, of 30 Years of Age at the Time of his Death; one whose black and savage Nature did no ways answer the Comliness of his Person, his Life
This inhumane Monster had been concerned with others, in insuring Ships to a great Value, and then destroying them; by which Means, and other Rogueries, he had got a little Money; and being Mate of a Ship, was dilligent enough in trading for himself
_Roche_ getting acquainted with one _Neal_, a Fisherman at _Cork_, whom he found ready for any villainous Attempt, he imparted his Design to him, who being pleas'd with the Project, brings one _Pierce Cullen_ and his Brother into the Confederacy, together
They pitch'd upon a Vessel in the Harbour, belonging to _Peter Tartoue_, a _French_ Man, to execute their cruel Intentions upon, because it was a small one, and had not a great Number of Hands on Board, and 'twas easy afterwards to exchange it for one more
The 15th of _November_, at Night, was the Time designed for the Tragedy; but _Francis Wise_ relented, and appear'd desirous to divert them from their bloody Purposes.
_Roche_ (sometimes called Captain) told him, _That as_ Cullen _and he had sustained great Losses at Sea, unless every_ Irishman _present would assist in repairing their Losses, by murthering all the_ French _Rogues, and running away with the Ship, he
_ Upon this, they all resolved alike, and Captain _Roche_ ordered three _Frenchmen_ and a Boy up to hand the Topsails, the Master and Mate being then asleep in their Cabins, The two first that came down, they beat out their Brains and threw them
Those who were asleep, being awakened by the dismal Skrieks and Groans of dying Men, ran upon Deck in Confusion, to enquire into the Cause of such unusual Noises; but the same Cruelty was immediately acted towards them, e'er they could be sensible of the
They were now (as _Roche_ himself afterwards confess'd) _all over as wet with the Blood that had been spilt, as if they had been dipp'd in Water, or stood in a Shower of Rain, nor did they regard it any more.
Roche_ said, Captain _Tartoue_ used many Words for Mercy, and asked them, if he had not used them with Civility and Kindness?
If they were not of the same Christian Religion, and owned the same blessed _Jesus_, and the like?
But they, not regarding what he said, took Cords and bound the poor Master and his Mate Back to Back, and while that was doing, both of them begged with the utmost Earnestness, and used the most solemn Intreaties, that they would at least allow them a few
The Massacre being finished, they washed themselves a little from the Blood, and searched the Chests and Lockers, and all Places about the Ship, and then set down in the Captain's Cabin, and refreshed themselves with some Rum they found there, and (as
They invested _Roche_ with the Command of the Ship, and calling him Captain, talked over their Liquor, what rare Actions they would perform about Cape _Briton, Sable Isle_, and the Banks of _Newfoundland_, whither they designed to go as soon as they had
_Roche_ taking upon himself the Command of the Vessel, _Andrew Cullen_ was to pass for a Merchant or Super-cargo; but when they bethought themselves, that they were in Danger of being discovered by the Papers of the Ship, relating to the Cargo, as Bills of
_ therefore they erase and take out the Name of the _French_ Master, and instead thereof, inserted the Name of _Roche_, so that it stood in the Ship's Papers, _Peter Roche_ Master; that then having so few Hands on Board, they contrived if they met any
In going to _Cales_ they were in Distress by the Weather, and being near _Lisbon_, they made Complaint to a Ship, but obtained no Assistance.
They were then obliged to sail back for _England_, and put into the Port of _Dartmouth_; but then they were in fear least they might be discovered, therefore to prevent that, they resolve to alter the Ship, and getting Workmen, they take down the
Then they took down the Image of St. _Peter_ at the Head of the Ship, and put up a Lion in its Place, and painted over the Stern of the Ship with Red, and new nam'd her the _Mary_ Snow.
The Ship being thus alter'd that they thought it could not be known, they fancy'd themselves pretty secure; but wanting Money to defray the Charge of these Alterations, _Roche_, as Master of the Vessel, and _Andrew Cullen_, as Merchant, apply themselves to
After this, they were obliged to put into several Ports, and by contrary Winds, came to the Coast of _France_, and hearing there was an Enquiry made after the Ship, _Roche_ quits her at _Havre de Grace_, and leaves the Management to _Cullen_ and the rest;
_ Some Time after this, _Philip Roche_ came to _London_, and making some Claim for Money, he had made Insurance of, in the Name of _John Eustace_, the Officer was apprized of the Fraud, and he arrested and flung into the Compter; from whence directing a
Upon this, an Information was given to my Lord _Carteret_, that the Person who went by the Name of _John Eustace_, was _Philip Roche_, as aforesaid; and being brought down by his Lordships Warrant, he stifly deny'd it for some Time, notwithstanding a
Two were discovered by him, who died miserably in the _Marshalsea_, and _Roche_ himself was afterwards try'd, (no more being taken,) found Guilty of the Pyracy, and executed.
An ABSTRACT of the Civil Law and Statute Law now in Force, in Relation to Pyracy.
A _Pyrate is_ Hostis humanis generis, _a common Enemy, with whom neither Faith nor Oath is to be kept, according to_ Tully.
_And by the Laws of Nature, Princes and States are responsible for their Neglect, if they do not provide Remedies for restraining these sort of Robberies.
Though Pyrates are called common Enemies, yet they are properly not to be term'd so.
He is only to be honour'd with that Name, says_ Cicero, _who hath a Commonwealth, a Court, a Treasury, Consent and Concord of Citizens, and some Way, if Occasion be, of Peace and League: But when they have reduced themselves into a Government or State, as
_ _If Letters of_ Marque _be granted to a Merchant, and he furnishes out a Ship, with a Captain and Mariners, and they, instead of taking the Goods, or Ships of that Nation against whom their Commission is awarded, take the Ship and Goods of a Friend, this
_ _If a Ship is assaulted and taken by the Pyrates, for Redemption of which, the Master becomes a Slave to the Captors, by the Law_ Marine, _the Ship and Lading are tacitly obliged for his Redemption, by a general Contribution; but if it happen through his
_ _If Subjects in Enmity with the Crown of_ England, _are abord an_ English _Pyrate, in Company with_ English, _and a Robbery is committed, and they are taken; it is Felony in the_ English, _but not in the Stranger; for it was no Pyracy in them, but the
_ _If Pyracy is committed by Subjects in Enmity with_ England, _upon the_ British _Seas, it is properly only punishable by the Crown of_ England, _who have_ istud regimen & Dominem _exclusive of all other Power.
_ _If Pyracy be committed on the Ocean, and the Pyrates in the Attempt be overcome, the Captors may, without any Solemnity of Condemnation, hang them up at the Main-Yard; if they are brought to the next Port, and the Judge rejects the Tryal, or the Captors
_ _If Merchandize be delivered to a Master, to carry to one Port, and he carries it to another, and sells and disposes of it, this is not Felony; but if, after unlading it at the first Port, he retakes it, it is Pyracy.
_ _If a Pyrate attack a Ship, and the Master for Redemption, gives his Oath to pay a Sum of Money, tho' there be nothing taken, yet it is Pyracy by the Law_ Marine.
_If a Ship is riding at Anchor, and the Mariners all ashore, and a Pyrate attack her, and rob her, this is Pyracy.
_ _If a Man commit Pyracy upon the Subjects of any Prince, or Republick_, (_though in Amity with us,) and brings the Goods into_ England, _and sells them in a Market_ Overt, _the same shall bind, and the Owners are for ever excluded.
_ _If a Pyrate enters a Port of this Kingdom, and robs a Ship at Anchor there, it is not Pyracy, because not done_, super altum Mare; _but is Robbery at common Law, because_ infra Corpus Comitatus.
_A Pardon of all Felonies does not extend to Pyracy, but the same ought to be especially named.
